For all my older connections - hopefully you don’t mind me assuming you’re up for it ?! 😂</p><p>Reeds always focus their reunions on the years who have the 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th etc anniversary’s - so next year it’s our turn 😀 30th June 2024. SAVE THE DATE !!</p><p>And unlike my O-levels and A-levels I haven’t left it to the last minute, but planning ahead !</p><p>It has been a lot of fun tracking you all down and catching up briefly and I’m delighted everyone has been keen to supply mobiles and connect via WhatsApp ! (So far !!).</p><p>Happy Bank Holiday for those in the UK !
But there are a handful what are not in the UK !! Roger Attwell (USA), Joe Chan (Toronto), Jeremy Chipchase (Australia - chasing him for his number ), Malcolm MacDonald (Isle of Man, probably counts ?), Simon-Piers O’Mahoney (Transylvania), Peter Potts (California).</p><p>A few things to do over the next weeks and months. 
#1 if you can spare a paragraph or two, it would be superb to catch up on your journey ! 
#2 let me know if you have any connections that aren’t on here and would love to add (for our “year group” !!!)….</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>So here is my brief update:-</p><p>Following A level retakes at Guildford Tech 😂 went to Kingston Poly doing Computer Science, so naturally went onto the software industry. I‘ve lived in Liphook, Hampshire, for the last 20+ years. Still working in software (for a few more years yet !). Happily (in case she reads this) married to Jo with 3 kids, Tom (28), Emily (27), and Ollie (19).
I spend my leisure time in Lycra - mountain bike riding and road riding - with the only focus as the hydration at the end 😻</p><p>I kept in touch with Andy Shiells after leaving and over the years we windsurfed, played rugby, and cricket (when he was desperate) and exchanged “best men” duties. Then Dave Edwards as we coached mini rugby at ORs. Then latterly Andy Glass, Pixie and Dave Wilkinson (just missing Pascal Shaw’s golfing debut a few years ago). Pete Griffin joined us golfing one year. Also at the odd event seen Adam Bailey (I think he counts - just), Wolfie Smith and Mark Reid !
Catching up with Chris and Barry on occasion over the years. And about 20 years ago, Nick Carey, John Vocking, Gus Finney for a few beers in London !! Plus Jeremy Chipchase came to a fundraiser in the early noughties ! Only a couple of years ago a long chat with Nev Stevens !
Also connected with a handful on Facebook which has been superb seeing photos etc !</p><p>Bizarrely I still have a connection to Reeds as my brother-in-law, Clappie, still teaches there as does my nephew “Clappie Junior”. Jo’s sister Clare is married to Clappie. That’s a story for over a beer !</p><p>Looking forward to everyone’s updates !!!!</p></div>

It's like we blinked and here we are, with life's journey etching its storylines onto our faces.✨</p><p>Since those unforgettable school days, my path has been quite the adventure. I dove deep into the world of computing, earning a PhD that unlocked a universe of possibilities. 🖥️📚</p><p>Over two decades ago, I took a leap of faith and founded a company in the heart of London, watching it grow and thrive.</p><p>But the call of the wild beckoned, and I found myself in Canada, chasing the allure of pristine landscapes and endless outdoor escapades. The Great White North became a second home, with a Peruvian love by my side and a Canadian daughter named Sabrina, who's added a new dimension of joy to my life. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</p><p>Eventually, I found myself drawn to the tech mecca of Silicon Valley, where the sun always shines and innovation fills the air. Kayaking, hiking, and running became my sanctuaries, helping balance out my array of nerdy hobbies that I've proudly held onto all these years. 🚣‍♂️🏃‍♂️📚</p><p>And guess what's on the horizon? Retirement is peeking around the corner, with plans to embrace the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas. 🎰</p><p>Can't wait to hear all your stories of the last four decades.

        <div class="content"><p>As for me, well I played rugby a few years for the ORs whilst at Oxford Poly with Andy Glass. Then became an Accountant and worked in London for 10 years in banking. Married to Mitch with  Ruby 23 and Joey 22. Moved out of London to Devon working in Pharma for 5 years before relocating to Switzerland for the past 12 years. Feel very privileged to have that opportunity as it is a great lifestyle on our doorstep. Now working on/off as a consultant, but trying to be more off nowadays and hoping to step away from the workplace, most likely not in Switzerland.
Keeping up to date with Andy G & S, Mark, Dave, Pascal, Barry. Looking forward to reuniting with you other lads. We should make a weekend of it 😀</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>For me: I stumbled through A levels and rather than Uni I headed off to the city and was a Lloyd’s broker for a few years (that’s where I bumped into Andy Marsh and we’ve remained in touch and get together now and again). Late 90s I had a spell living in Bermuda working in Risk Management, and returned to continue that in ‘98. Work-wise since then I have concentrated on risk and crisis management and spent eight years up until 2019 as a kidnap and hostage responder; work that has enabled me to travel a fair amount, work with some interesting people, and get some kicks. While living in London I met my wife Frances (while playing for Battersea Wanderers) and we have a daughter Eleanor (14) who is at Millfield and playing hockey, cricket and netball for Somerset. We. We now live in Hampshire and I continue umpiring hockey as the lockdown weight incurred won’t shift itself, I also play in heavy rock band which I formed back in 2015 and we gig a bit - it’s just that finding the venues that’ll have us and the volume is the tough bit. There, it’s always just the good stuff, eh; rather than some of the dreadful sh*t we have had to soldier though during our lives!!!</p></div>

I didn't make it to Reeds sixth form as the family were set to relocate to NZ. I crammed my A levels in a year at Guilford Tech and then the move fell through!!(long story!) Anyway I ended up at North Staffordshire Poly taking French and International Relations and then a PGCE at Leeds Uni.</p><p>After 14 months of backpacking around the world, I started my first teaching job in Addlestone. I then taught 4 years in Penang, Malaysia where I met and married my Malaysian wife, Adeline. Did a lot of sport there, including competition rugby and hockey.</p><p>We moved back to Brighton where both my daughter Keomi(19) and my son Johan(18) were born. Got a teaching job in Dubai and ended up there for 10 years. Came back to the UK 8 years ago and set up my Educational Consultancy company which supports schools globally on Climate change and Sustainability education. 40 years in the blink of an eye😀.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Malcolm here, as you all will most probably remember I did not quite make it to 5th form to sit my O'levels, Reeds and Basil Green in particular made it clear that I was not welcome back. I ended up sitting my O'Levels at Heathside and then did a year at Brooklands Tech before I realised education and I were not good bed fellows. I left the UK in 1984 on what I thought would be a two year working holiday in South Africa and started working in Insurance. Married, now happily divorced I have a 32 year old Daughter (Kaylee) and two grandchildren  (Odin 5 and Lexi 2 or Thor,as I prefer to call her). I stayed in SA till 2000 when I returned to the UK, still in Insurance I lived in Staffordshire until 2021 when I got offered a job on the Isle of Man that was too good to turn down. Very happy on this little island until we are invaded by bikers for TT.  I still turn out for the local cricket team, specialist drinker and chairman of the fines committee are my strong points. Nice to see so many familiar names here.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Well, after catching the international travel bug from trips to Hong Kong & Malaysia to visit Joe, Perry & Rob, I’ve been unstoppable: Engineering degree at Loughborough, then 11y at British Airways in their golden years, moved to Budapest for 9y, learned Hungarian, married a Hungarian from Transylvania, became Irish & joined the Irish Embassy, then some years as Director of the national airline, Malév, before the govt gave it away to an oligarch family! Moved to Vienna for a couple of years then Transylvania in 2010, many years involved with Microfinance there + Serbia + Kenya. Now Regional Director & Group Marketing Director at ATG from Ireland. We have 3 kids: Ákos 16, Tóla 14, Niamh 4. I think I might be able to claim the spot as the father of the youngest kid in this group?</p></div>

Kept the rugby (just local 3rds stuff) going into my mid 30’s… stayed down in Brighton/Hove for about 10 yrs, accidentally finding myself in sales (software then telecoms).</p><p>After a few ups and downs, geographically (lived in Surrey, Brighton, Sheffield, Oxford, London, Manchester, Newbury, as well as looking after the Nordics for few years) and metaphorically (couple of awkwardly timed redundancies) I finally decided on a gentler work/life balance when I joined the OS about 10 yrs ago.</p><p>Found my soul mate (Wendy) on the 2nd time of asking and just celebrated the 20th anniversary of our 1st date. One boy (Robbie 28) and one stepdaughter (Saskia 25) both thankfully moved out (I won’t say grown up!), and we’re now settled just outside Portsmouth.</p><p>Spent most of my money on beer, rugby and sailing… the rest of it I wasted 😁</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Wow what a turn-out! Great to see everyone here and read all the stories of what you've been up to the last decades. Well done Mark for getting this together, hat off to you mate.</p><p>For me a career in tech was always on the cards really so after spending three years studying computer systems in sunny Salford (basically an electronic engineering degree and probably not the perfect choice in hindsight) and graduating with a "Desmond" 2-2 it was straight into the software industry where I have remained since, although in my late 20s a career change into music was a serious consideration. I became a massive collector of a pretty broad range of vinyl, most of it dancable, and landed many DJ gigs of varying sizes mostly through the 90s-00s timeframe, although I have kept my hand in off and on right up to covid, which killed the nice bar in East Dulwich where I had a residency. Currently angling for another nice weekend spot in Cambridge, but let's see, it was much easier in London really.</p><p>Like you Nick it took me two goes to get it right in marriage but coming up to 10 years together now with my lovely Alexandra and couldn't be happier in my home life. I have a daughter who will be 17 in November and has just smashed her GCSEs out of the park. Distance means we don't spend all that much time together but it's quality over quantity and we have a great relationship.</p><p>Seems like you all are at it on the sports field, good on you for that - I'm sure you remember exactly how sports-averse I was in school (even Nicky "Sly" always saying how I never got mud on my knees on the rugby pitch!) but I did manage to get myself in shape a bit, with a few different martial arts and then latterly a few solid years of Crossfit. I even managed to put some muscle on, but it all went to pot during covid and I need to climb back in the saddle really.</p><p>Aside from music I'm still into the photography (and I must now dig out some old negs from school years which I do still have somewhere) and also a fairly serious-grade petrolhead. I'll take off to Wales or Scotland on a driving mission a few times a year.</p><p>Ok that's enough waffle for one message, I'll leave it there for now!

I've actually returned to listening to them, and have grabbed a couple of the anniversary vinyl releases (all I had were tapes of other people's copies back in the day) - they have gone through a sort of geek vindication in more recent years, there's even a halo documentary on Netflix - but when I discovered jazz fusion then I realised what my ears were really looking for in all that prog rock, Billy Cobham being the absolute god of the drum kit - saw him live in the mid 90s, absolutely incredible to watch him play with two sticks in each hand, what a master</p></div>

Have since run a number of companies in the health arena, most recently at BUPA, before moving to Devon in my current role as MD at Taking Care (the UK’s largest private provider of  personal alarms to the elderly, which is actually a lot more fun than it sounds… 😂😂😂) Celebrating 31 years of marriage to Karen this year (who I met at Uni) and blessed with two daughters (30 and 28 - Neo-natal intensive care nurse and police dispatcher: so a good public service balance to my nakedly commercial career 😎😎) and son (19 - at Aberystwyth Uni doing veterinary bioscience) AND two granddaughters. Three dogs and a habit of still attending hardcore dance raves when I can and we certainly all feel busy…. looking forward to catching up properly with everyone face-to-face</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Mark, thanks for getting us together. It’s great to hear everyone’s news. 40 years but the connection is there instantly! 
After Reeds I read Engineering at Bristol Uni where I also played rugby (badly but I enjoyed it and made lots of friends) until a back injury stopped me. These days I run, swim and cycle, slower as each year goes. I’ve been married to Denise for 27 years and we have two sons, Niall who turned 24 today (he is autistic) and Oliver who is reading Maths at Bath Uni.
After training as a Chartered Accountant at EY where I met Denise I worked in finance for a couple of international companies in the information business for some 20 years. I was fortunate enough to travel a lot with work and spent some time in the US and Turkey. These days I do voluntary and non-exec work. Looking forward to our reunion next year 😀.</p></div>

Going to the Vic and playing indoor hockey in the Gym,  also falling off the balcony backwards into crash mats!</p><p>After Reeds I went to Farnham 6th form college. But did return to Reed’s for a day to resit my English Level. Had two of my best years of education,  not of the academic sort though 😎.</p><p>Started work at the DHSS in 85 and after a brief but tragic stint as a photocopier salesman I then worked for Egon Ronay, the start of my waistline increasing.</p><p>After that I started at BA in 1987 and stayed there for 13 years, meeting my wife and getting married in 1991. Then moved to a television company before that went bust and moved onto a program manger role with Sainsburys online operation. Then a stint at Sky before returning to BA as an IT project manager in 2005 where I remain. Plan to retire in 4 years, out at least do something different that I enjoy and has less pressure.</p><p>Saw Dave at a Reed’s reunion day probably 20 years ago. Have social media contact with Pascal (Le Frog) Nick Carey, Jon Rigby, Shaun Gough and Nick Haigh.  Also bumped into a few when I was working in TV at Mortimer street. Wonder what happened to some people that have no web presence at all, Tom Hardiment and Paul(Willy) Rushton for example. Did bump into Paul at a tube station in the mid 80s, he was working in the city at the time.</p><p>Still married, over 30 years now, and have two daughters, 30 and 27 and they have finally left home😁  . Live in Chertsey, and work at Heathrow, do a lot of travelling, perks of the job, but also cycle a lot and was playing Hockey up to about 7 years ago. 
Unlike AD, alcohol and too much of the bad things in life account for my less than youthful appearance.</p><p>Turkey!</p></div>

The last time we were all together, Frankie goes to Hollywood was at the top of the chart while we all went different paths to discover life possibilities. Since art was my fav subject or the only subject I could pass without Perry or Simon passed me the exam answer. Manchester was my first stop after Reeds to learn design & how to drink beer(s). Then I came to explore Canada; a super chill place, the government has not kick me out…yet; may be they lost my address. Now living in downtown Toronto, diversity here is awesome.</p><p>I'm a graphic designer, partnering with advertising agencies, providing creative solutions to solve their client's marketing problems, a fun proposition most of the time. A few years back, one of our client found Andy Glass, a fantastic photographer, then we both contribute to a project, from different country, small world indeed. Once in a blue mooooon, I connect with Simon Mahoney (O’Mahony now) and Perry Lim-Low.</p><p>Married to Ivy, she said she will have kids when I grow up—still waiting. Off-hours, we like experiencing the food scene. Recently, I picked up electric skateboarding and living dangerously. Luckily, I'm still alive to write this message as a few years ago, a Tesla T-bone my face, no pun intended. Looking forward to c u all & share a few pints.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Wow!!! I wasn’t sure whether to read messages 1st or start to contribute, but similar to school…I can’t keep up, 🤪…so will go ahead and share my story…already amazing to hear your stories and see the pictures, crazy to think 40 years have passed! For me, as my house ‘The Griffin’ became the local smoking and coffee den, it became a major distraction from school life, so I was encouraged to find alternative places to expand the mind! 🤗…so after a couple of years at catering college I went off travelling for a couple of years that cemented my passion for being out and about.  I have lived in the Kingston Upon Thames area since 1988, which some might remember was a stock market crash and mortgage rates went to 16%!!! ….and I owned a house with my mate and brother from a different mother ‘Fozz’ (I am sure many of you will remember from the Vic)…but we survived hook or by crook and during that time I spend a lot of time drinking and partying with Pete Griffin and Neil Smith, and played rugby for Reeds under captain ship of Pix! It was in this time I married my life partner, Gaily, and we have 2 children ‘Georgie (30) a Yoga Teacher and Harry (27) running music events and promotions. I found myself a sales job for Philip Morris Cigarettes (that was still a passion of mine 😵‍💫) which led to sales at American Express which set my course for a career in payments, loyalty and finance. Over the years I have remained heavily involved with Reeds Rugby due to my son starting there at 4, and Finchie, Shiela and I spend many years coaching the boys. With the love of travel and I am fortunate to now only needing to work part time, Gaily and I have spend most of the last few years traveling in Campervans and Motorhomes in the far reaches of Europe….and with a combo of golf, rugby and beers, it’s been amazing to have life long friendships with several folks on this group…well done Finchie for setting this up, not sure you were expecting an avalanche though! 🤠</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Great to hear from you Peter…I have so many fond memories of our junior years hanging around your house or cycling in Oxshott Woods! Your parents were the closet thing to an Auntie and Uncle, and I have very special memories of your dad, Ken, smoking his pipe on a Sunday afternoon in his lounge listening to classical music, walking the dogs with us and bringing back exotic fruits from his travels, he was the 1st person to intro us to Kiwi Fruit! Ironically my sister, Alison,  is with us at the moment, over from NZ, where she has lived for over 30 years and my other sister, Debbie, is over from Spain. We have all been reminiscing on how our families used to spend time with each other. Unfortunately, mum & dad (Norman & Margaret) are not with us anymore. How about Ken and Rosalind?…and Sandy (or is he Alexander now?)</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Great idea - probably a Google Doc rather than a sheet makes most sense I would've thought but either is good. It's one of the downsides of WhatsApp that you can grant permission for new group joiners to see the whole history (at least, I assume that is still a current restriction, might be worth a careful check of the options to confirm). Related to the end-to-end encryption perhaps, as there is no central server record of the messages. One of the many reasons I prefer Telegram but that's not as universal unfortunately.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Thanks Finchie for persevering in connecting with me🙏. Unlike many of the ORs from our year who have stayed in touch over the years, this is the first time for me to be back in touch with you all. I never saw that coming either. Thanks for the great welcome.</p><p>My story in brief: After leaving Reeds I went to Bath University to study Materials Science (basically a course for those who can’t decide between the various science and engineering courses, and some would say the soft option 😉). Upon graduating from Bath in 1988, I was drawn North by the beauty of Scotland and worked for BP in Grangemouth. My future wife, Lynn and I met in my first weeks there (I had also joined the local rugby club and promptly broke a metatarsal bone in my foot, so I stood out somewhat as a new graduate on crutches with a stooky (Scottish for plaster-cast)). In the early years I spent most of my time mountaineering with a local club, and windsurfing and waterskiing on Loch Lomond. Lynn and I married in 1991 and then in 1992 we moved to Geneva with BP, to continue the mountaineering and windsurfing theme, but added skiing to the mix. Our son was born in Switzerland before BP closed the office there and we relocated to England in 1996. Our daughter was born soon after in England. After 25 years with BP and then Ineos, I transitioned from black to green to work in the wind power sector with Siemens, and am still in the wind industry now, but we have since moved back to Scotland (it’s just a truly magical place). Our kids are now 28 and 26 and both live and work in London. There seems to be less time for hill walking (although I do still get away occasionally). I am very involved in my local Church - I am on the leadership team and so most Sundays are taken up. Perhaps more unusually, I am an apiarist (i.e. a beekeeper) and I enjoy foraging (who doesn’t like free food) and I make stuff out of wood (usually that I have sliced up using a chain saw). 
Looking forward to catching up in person.😄</p></div>

After Reeds took a year off and then went to Hull to do Law. Got a degree and went to Guildford Law School and started a career as a solicitor. It soon became clear that wasn't the right decision and after a year and half qualified I left. Took a couple of years of knocking on doors, doing temp jobs etc but eventually broke into TV production. And have been doing it ever since. Mostly freelance so  did a couple of years on The Big Breakfast, Big Brother and a few years going to Australia every year for I'm a Celebrity.  Tried my hand at commissioning at Sky, ran Gordon Ramsay's production co for a while (turns out he's a t**t - who knew?!) and now I'm running Mentorn Media. We make Question Time and Traffic Cops amongst other things. 
Personally - and more importantly - I married Sarah Parker (Sparker - for those of you knew her back in the day). We have 2 children. Joe 16 and Betty 15 - have been in Balham Sth London for over 20 years. Loved hearing all your stories and looking forward to catching up.</p></div>

I too remember Chris breaking his arm in the close, I was standing there at the top of the wall and won’t forget🙈

Loved Alan King but my favourite had to be Eric… rugby, biology & CCF, 3 of my favourite things lol - on tour to Amsterdam constantly calling the local currency “gliders”. Nicky Sly my most feared, and I only got him in 6th form! Geoff could be both terrifying and avuncular at the same time! 🤣</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>A quick potted history of the interim years 
Did an amazing trip round the US with chris brogden in a year off … not quite sure how we survived as most of the way we both h hiked 
Then ended up at Leeds  Uni followed by doing a photography course in oth Andy Glass which shaped both of our futures. 
I spent seven great years in Yorkshire then moved to East London where I lived in a Lithuanian village hall complete with 24hr drinking den downstairs frequented by East London gangsters and vodka drinking east Europeans . It was quite messy</p><p>Then met my ex partner Soraya and moved to Somerset where we had a daughter Lyla ( who is now 17) and did up two ruined buildings but unfortunately it ruined us too. 😁still friends we live in the two buildings 
Mine is the Drugstore which is where I run the Drugstore Gallery from.</p><p>We do art fairs in the Uo and abroad and have had the chance to do lots of crazy trips … following the Yangtze across China sponsored by Nikon and spending a week in a tribal  village in the Amazon . For some reason me and my work has made me quite famous in a small part of Germany.  It’s a funny old world</p><p>I did a book on banksys dismaland and he put 30 of the pictures form it on his website for two years and no I’m afraid I can’t tell you anything about him</p><p>A few years ago I was asked to curate an art exhibition by old reedonians in London so got to see a few folk then and am in contact with Zaid and Tim clark who both are talented creatives</p><p>More to follow but lovely to reconnect</p></div>

To be honest I have not maintained much contact with people from school since we left save a few.</p><p>So a little about my journey.  I completely failed my A-levels owing to spending far too much time sailing rather than schooling, though somehow, I managed to get into further education at Brighton Poly.  That kept me in contact with Nick Carey and Guy Finned through university days and for a while after.</p><p>Having decided that the Engineering degree I got was not what I wanted I got into IT and moved from Brighton to the Farnborough/Camberley area. This is where I met my wife, Zoe, and we are celebrating our 30th anniversary this year.</p><p>After school I spent a lot of time with Mark Foulsham (happy birthday today!) and Guy Wood (RIP ☹️).  That was really the basis of my main social circle at that time.</p><p>In 1999 we had our first child, Elizabeth (now 23 and in Law School) and then in 2001 I decided to take a work opportunity and move the family to the States, landing on the East Coast in the New York Area.  In 2005 I got into consulting and that took me all over the States and working with all sorts of companies.  It is still what I do today but with much less travel.  In 2008 we had a second child, Isabelle, who is now 15, failing High School, and who is likely to be Elizabeths first client!</p><p>Through my consulting days I was spending way too much time on the West Coast and so about 10 years ago we moved to the San Francisco Bay Area which is where I am now.  Without a doubt the best part of the world I have lived in so far.</p><p>My memories of Reeds are mixed, some good mainly in the really stupid shit we got up to and some bad, mainly the education.  I have often wondered what it would be like to be more connected to people from those days so maybe this is a chance.</p><p>I don’t have much opportunity to get back to the UK but am looking to see if I can make this reunion work in some way.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Hi Nick, I must say I echo your comments about mixed feelings about Reed’s; I think there were some great times, but I think in some respects there were times when we were a bit let down by the teaching. It seems a bit weird that quite a few boys could fall through holes in an educational net; that said, I think the school prepared us for life, and even though perhaps many of us on this in this group didn’t really succeed academically, we were all able to make a pretty good fist of it all.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Great to hear from you, Nick, and it sounds like a really interesting journey you have been on. Definitely get the mixed feelings thing about Reeds. I did keep in touch briefly with a few people after I left after 5th form, including Guy Wood, rest his soul. It was weird because, as I didn't go through 6th form, I didn't really feel like an OR, but it is great to be back in touch after so long. In my consultancy role, I work a lot with UK independent schools, and they have certainly changed. Good in ways, but they can't get away with the stuff we did and I guess that was why we remember so well the fun of firecrackers, crazy kitchen staff, slightly dodgy teachers, gozzing, playing rugby in heavy snow, Ma Holt's knickers. I remember selling raw leeks that I grew to starving boarders in the Close! Being caught coming out of the broom cupboard having found the passage down the WW2 air raid shelter. After 40 years, there are some great stories coming from everyone, and looking forward to catching up in June.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Ok Gents. Here’s my life recap. Apologies for length but hey, I’m old!</p><p>Left Reeds after O’ Levels for Kingston sixth form college (along with Marc Yates, Bert Nichols and Neville Stevens) having convinced my Dad that I wanted to study computer science and couldn’t do it at Reeds. Gave up computer science after 1 year (very angry Dad!) and might as well have given up my other 2 A Level choices too, as being left to my own devices to attend lectures and study didn’t seem to work too well (too many pubs in Kingston 🤣). Messed around for a few years working in pubs and call centres before heading off to Australia on a working holiday in 1992. Visa eventually ran out and not wanting to go back to England, got a job as a holiday rep for Thomson holidays and spent the next 3 summers in Tenerife looking after British tourists and leading pub crawls of up to 500 drunk Brits through the streets of Playa de Las Americas! Met Cosmos rep, Tracy, in Tenerife (from Crewe not Essex – not sure which is worse) and we’ve now been together for 32 years now and have a daughter, Natasha, aged 15. Then on to Crete, Malta followed by 3 years in Gran Canaria selling timeshare of all things (amazing what a private education can do for you) resulting in the start of my sales career. Then on to Canada, Belgium, Budapest and back to Canada. Became a Canadian Citizen, then found a work sponsorship opportunity, which took me back to Australia in 2004. 14 years in Sydney and past 5 years living on the Sunshine Coast of Australia. Bloody wonderful place to live and very happy here. Once I turned 50, decided it was time to try and reverse the many years of smoking and boozing and am probably fitter now than I ever have been. I ocean swim, play golf, tennis, run and go to the gym. Also hiked to Everest Base camp in May, which was pretty amazing. Changed my career in 2007 and found my way into the recruitment sector and am now working for a small tech business involved in corporate psychometric assessment. Keen on most sports, still a Chelsea fan and always England, especially when against Australia 😁. I stay in touch with Marc Yates (he lives in Taunton) although try not to advertise that too loudly!
 
Highlights of my Reeds education include Mr Proctor firing a well-aimed piece of chalk at my forehead and calling me a social leper 😂, being caught going through the school front door, resulting in my first experience of the cane and Mr Green making it very clear that life would be easier for me if I didn’t give up playing the oboe (I’m sure there was a similar type scene in the Shawshank Redemption!). Fond memories also, of going to Claygate (Hare & Hounds, I think) with Jeremy Chipchase for my first pint in a pub, aged 14, hanging round at Dave Edwards place smoking and listening to Meatloaf and Rush. Also recall a great punch up with Wolfie Smith in the Bristowe common room (honourable draw) with Marc Yates, in the background, shouting ”hit him Wolfie, hit him!” How I went on to be Yates’s best man at his wedding is beyond me!
 
This chat group/reunion is evoking so many memories – bloody good to be in touch with you all. Well done Finchie. Very sadly, won’t be able to make the reunion (unless there’s scope for a change of date!). Cheers, Giles.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>One main difference from Reeds to my prep school was the family structure. Reeds was an orphanage  or something  similar when it was set up. Those values seemed to carry on to our time there. My mum was a single parent at that stage and most of my friends at Reeds were in the same situation. That helped my mum too, meeting like minded mums . At the prep school it was mainly 2 parent, multiple children families. I preferred the Reeds vibe.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>I must be a bit of a weirdo (shut up at the back there! No need to agree so vehemently! 😁) but I have (almost) entirely fond memories of school… It might have helped that I was a day boy, so “got away” every night, although the older I got, the more time I spent at school, often not going home til 9.00 or 10.00 at night (home was fine but cloying & a bit isolating)… probably not a top notch education but then I never really put any pressure on it (always been a bit of a coaster). I would echo the several comments that it was the shenanigans we got up to and learning to beat the system (almost the unwritten subject on the curriculum) that served us best.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>In a slightly bizarre or perverted way, I am slightly reassured by the the overall dissatisfaction in the educational levels for our year; perhaps it was a trough that they were in at the time as I recall my brother’s year, two years above, seemed to have suffered a similar fate (ALL) bright folk.  Maybe time to seek reparations….s’what folks do these days, eh.  As Malcolm said, not what we as adults would consider a reasonable ROI. My biggest peave came when Geoff Martin dropped me from the 1st Eleven or something because I chose to play for Surrey against Sussex that particular Saturday. It’s also one of the reasons I have sent my daughter to Millfield; to avoid that kind of parochial attitude. I saw Geoff at an ORs reunion about 8 years ago, still thought he was a twat. Rant over, soz.

        <div class="content"><p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Reed's School. I had a great rapport with the teachers and had a genuine interest in sports, although I had to bid farewell to rugby due to a string of injuries. Looking back, I realize how fortunate we were because California's private schools have relatively modest sports facilities. This led me to transfer my daughter to a public high school, which have impressive setups, although she still showed no interest in sports, which was a bit disappointing.</p><p>I scraped admission into Reed's School because of my exceptional math skills only. During that time, my father faced a life-threatening brain tumor with only a 25% chance of survival. We chose Reed's because they promised to keep me enrolled even if the worst happened. Fortunately, my father survived, albeit with some disabilities, and he is now 89 years old.</p><p>Over the years, I steadily climbed the academic ranks, eventually becoming a favorite among the teachers during my A-levels. Such was their trust in me that even when I consumed a third of a bottle of whiskey and had an unfortunate encounter with Hewitt's feet, I escaped any punishment. I think they considered the horrendous hangover the following day punishment enough.</p><p>I cherish memories of fireworks being launched from our dormitory windows and the time someone mischievously set one off inside the dormitory, causing it to zip around without causing any harm or starting a fire.</p><p>My performance at A-levels was outstanding, earning me a place at Cambridge to study Mathematics. However, there was a condition attached – I had to pass an O-level in a foreign language. As a result, I extended my stay at Reed's for an additional year to study Latin; there was no way I was revisiting French.</p><p>During that extra year, I received a somewhat regal treatment, complete with my own room in Blathwayt. I even rigged up a sound system that would automatically turn off when the door opened. Poor Hewitt had a run-in with it when he attempted to reprimand me for playing music too loudly.</p><p>Upon arriving at Cambridge, I quickly realized I was lagging behind in Mathematics compared to my peers. While everyone else had studied Further Mathematics at A-level, Reed's had never offered that option. In my very first lecture at Cambridge, the professor urged us to forget everything we had learned in school because the real mathematical journey was commencing.</p><p>My time at Cambridge was a true eye-opener, offering a challenging and transformative experience. On the sports front, the hockey skills I acquired at Reed's proved incredibly valuable. I earned a spot in the St John's College first team for three years and even had the opportunity to play in the University 3rd team on one occasion.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>I think that was probably the UK record for the number of people that took a whacking ! It was from that PE teacher - I forget his name - Simon Spencer ? (Maybe)
Didn’t he get about 20 of us in a circle down at the close and whack us with his trainer. I have to admit, after that moment, I always felt I really should do discus ! 
For those not there. Picture the scenario. As you may recall, Chapel normally started at 8.40 spot on and a quick prayer ahead of finishing and then starting the day at 9. The “closits” were way down the front (so we were last out). 8.45 and still no teachers had arrived (they were probably chatting up that really fit French teacher). 
One of our year got very bored, and I’d hazard a guess it was any of Sprawson, Pendered, or Edwards. Thought it would be a good idea to lob a hymn book down the back at the 6th form.  Within nano seconds there were 200 hymn books in the air flying across the whole chapel in ALL directions - just at the moment the teachers decided to pop in for a prayer. That image is still embedded in my brain. Best chapel service we ever had 😂</p></div>

Sadly Littleboy had just laid a massive log about 5m from the tent and daintily put one sheet of toilet paper on top of it, covering about 10% of it. Rather than what anyone else would do and bury it ! Massive fail. Pascal and I made rolliies out of dry tealeaves and bog roll. Horrendous.

Can’t remember who was batting in the nets - maybe Garfield Hatton. Who ever it was drove one of the most powerful shots I have ever seen. Pasc had no chance of moving. Leather connected to scrotum. I swear I saw one of his balls pop out one of his nostrils momentarily. But the nightmare was the deep scream. A moan replicated in many horror movies since. Even sister Keenies blue gargle didn’t do the trick and he was carted off to hospital wimpering.

Being slight I was a flanker and one October the day before half term I ended up under the scum somehow, twisting my arm in the process. It hurt but I thought nothing of it, and played on to the whistle, but by then it was excrutiating. So I went to sickbay and nurse told me to soak it in warm water with a view to going home. They called my mum and next thing she was at school with Guy's mum, Lesley. [Guy was also a day boy] We were due to go to Florida the next day so it was agreed I would go to Epsom A&E. When I got there my right wrist was fractured and my elbow chipped. I got a cast and we flew out the next day. I'm not quite sure what the outcome would have been had the trip to the US not prompted a visit to A&E. I got back on the field for the rest of that term once my arm had healed.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Yeh. Approach to injury was appalling. Sure A-D was unconscious for a minute after nutting the metal rugby post.
Don Cameron (another day boy Zaid) dislocated or broke his shoulder playing for Mullens. Geoff just told him to walk up to sick bay on his own. He could of passed out. Insult to injury Geoff charged his parents for the cost of the rugby shirt A&E had to cut it off to operate...</p></div>

I can vouch for that as I was invited back to your place quite a few times to practice ! While the dancing was quite impressive - what was more impressive is that you had a SodaStream which - as a boarder going back to the middle east all the time - was like a river of gold to me. Coke made from water and syrup and carbonated. That was the real miracle - not that you could look like Adam Ant !</p><p>Luckily Kraftwork has not re-leased “He’s a model and he’s looking good…danana nanana na … na na..” and it has not been sampled - as I wouldn’t be able to get that dance out my head ! 😂</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>We were definitely born in the era to make or break you and have some memorable scars and war wounds! I’ve worked at Reeds in the med centre for the last 14 years treating sports injuries twice a week for the kids. I changed from banking to osteopathy in 2001 and never looked back. Guess the love of sport and lack of care at school hatched the business plan. They’ve now moved on to hiring a head injury doctor and a team of physios so matron doesn’t have to get her hands on the boys!! In the world of litigation rugby in schools is under threat but team bonding and life stories as we’ve had on this group also gets threatened. Safety and management is key but hopefully the easy path of banning it is resisted. Think CCF and DofE also have a week of risk assessments first ! Boring 😜</p></div>

The next part of the contract was digging up the sacred grass hockey pitch near to The Close that we were told as pupils was one of the finest in the country….it took 30 seconds to undo that legacy!</p></div>

Yesterdays slice of time…Most of us watching the England Vs Argentina battle (RWC) but back then it was the invasion in 1981, while Roger the Dodger encourages other people to do stuff (on this rare occasion it was good stuff) and Pottsy and Mike Nunan get techie. Plus Dave Edwards befriends random strangers and invites old friends back to his place. Meanwhile Duncan still has that smile, Jez talks cricket, Shiellsy takes the piss, Bazza and Finchie are the ideas men (waiting for others to deliver), Jonny still hates Geoff, Pete Milne is the sensible one. Nick still bitter about sharing the 7s trophy….

        <div class="content"><p>(Slightly serious and deep bit coming, soz) In many ways, I understand what Phil Umney’s thoughts might be; he and I spent quite some time together in the run-up to leaving and afterwards, and there was quite a lot of disenchantment, and largely it was down to some of the Masters’ attitude and behaviour to certain pupils. Reed’s did have a bit of a habit of being a place where it’s useful if your face fits. The threads and chats on this group are ‘squaring’ a few circles as they say. (I am not bitter) There are some folk on here that I spent many great formative years with and with whom I have quite an emotional attachment. Yes, this is a little deep for a Sunday morning, however, some of the folk on here I have known since we were three. Personally I feel a slight sense of imposter syndrome for this as I guess I had put SO much of it to the back of my mind striving to move on and achieve a worthwhile career - despite the masters not having ‘Fide’ in me. I was however at the school for 7 years - have I blanked SO much out? A few random memories: prep school at Moleside with SPM, Dave E, Peter M; meeting Andy Glass and Garf Hatton on an MCC cricket tour to Holland with Scaitcliffe School and Mike Gosling before we had even started at Reed’s! Apologies, but this is helpful for me.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>As there is something of a Yorkshire theme to the current posts - I thought I would chip in. I have not really thought about Reeds for a very long time - however my wife has thought I am loosing it as I have chuckled away to myself reading the posts. On reflection I have fond  memories of Reeds, academic education may not have been the best, however I think the overall experience was great and likely could not be repeated in todays more regulated / grade focussed world. After leaving Reeds - I started working at Lloyd’s of London (where I met James Eason, lounging nonchalantly against a syndicate box) after 3 years or so realised it was more like a club than work, so went into the money markets. Notwithstanding waving my arms around and shouting a lot - I not sure if I bought or sold very much at all and in need of a more normal life I moved to Yorkshire. Stumbled into banking - which will come as great amusement to anybody who shared a maths lesson with me. (Trick is to employ people much cleverer than you and delegate) I now live with my long suffering wife Ingrid (married 27 years) together with her horses and cats in rural Derbyshire. After nearly 30 years in the corporate bank, I am beginning to think about retirement - more travel etc Does not feel like I have been as busy over the past 40 years as many of you. Nick still remember the trip to Spain really well - Barry going to see Elton John - now I think about it - too many memories to write down.</p></div>

That first one was just incredible - I think Shiellsy met Tessa (I’ll let him update you). But I do know a few of you used to do the hay bailing on Tessa’s folks farm !
I would hazard a guess, Mandy was Amanda Ferguson ? American ? ! She could “flick flack” for England and Uber flexible !! :-) She was my “one that got away” as I went out with her for a while - but was way out of my comfort zone (and league) after a Sunday Tea at a very fancy London hotel meeting her parents learning they ran diamond mines in Africa. Oh how life could be different now !!! 
I reckon there was probably a second party at the Gardeners before I tag teamed with Barry ;-) 
I can’t let Chris’ comment about Caron go without an update - as she was legendary and Glasses OH for a long while - just to let many folk here (who would probably not know) she sadly passed away a couple of years ago in Thailand 🥲
Caron was great mates with Sarah and Rebecca and the Nortre Dame / Claremont girls, so while not involved in laddergate - certainly remember it. We have to track down Greg Anderson as he may have dated Rebecca ? 
I do remember the Notre Dame parties and I’m sure Glassey tried it on with a nun ? (He certainly did with the Claremont PE teacher). 
One disco involved a Claremont or Notre Dame fight Vs Reeds - for some strange reason Lucius Peart and myself were put up for Reeds. Poor chaps !!! :-)</p><p>Zaid - you are spot on about Pensotti’s entrance !!</p><p>Nick and Maria ! Oh what could have been ! 
Nick - was it the Thompson Twins ? As I have a recollection of a rugby tour to Lyme Regis and spending a whole day listening to Alf (one of the Thomson Twins ?) on my Sony Walkman, while looking out to sea wondering why I had no recollection of the night before (apparently I was found under a bush asleep at 3am) !!!</p><p>Happy days !</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>So here's my round-up ... and apologies, it's taken a bit of time.
First up it's great to see that you guys has such a good time in 6th form and embryonic friendships clearly deepened.
I took a different path and bailed out post O-levels. Not really sure what drove that, but I do remember a conversation with @447896340167 where I was telling him the benefits of staying for 6th form and he was telling me why it was time to go. I don't know if it was that conversation or my general sense of teenage apathy, but either way I felt I needed a change of scene and a different journey from the one my brothers had so effortlessly thrived in, so off I went.
I ended up at a local tech college and saw a very different side of life and then went on to do Business Studies. taking the heavy drinking option and it seems some of you took that course too! Realising I needed income, I went into advertising for around 10 years which enabled me to combine the drinking with something called work, which was all great fun. I then evolved into brand consulting and ended up as CEO of a company called Interbrand which took me all over the world and provided some great adventures. That all ended about 7 years ago and since then I've been doing some consultancy on my own, taken a few full time roles including time as CEO of a start-up consultancy, big fish, and I now work sporadically as a consultant, coach and volunteer a bit with the Samaritans. Along the way I was married for 20 years. That imploded spectacularly but I've not once regretted that ending! We had x3 kids, Violet 19, Sam 17 and Tilly 15 and I've now been with my new partner, MIchele, for the last 5 years. @447952310564 came by a few years ago which was great fun and brought back many happy memories. Anyway, in the spirit of Churchill wanting to write a short letter, but not having the time, I'll end it there. Delighted to see you're all doing so well from the notes unlocked by @16504609902. The pics are brilliant, maybe a few signs of lives well lived! Onwards!</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Hi Barry, I understand your viewpoint, but I am disinclined to erase the history; what we did, right or wrong, is part of the foundation of the formation of the persons in this group.  Yes, we did what we did but it was standard practice in a different era.  I understand that many persons want to take a new (woke) era forward but that can’t be at a cost of learning from happened previously.  
I would be happy to see a separate WhatsApp group set up where there is NO such discussion of the all manner of perverse and maladjusted things that occurred, but I am still in favour of the option to have a channel to discuss matters openly and with impunity as this is the enduring and binding material that made us who we are and what we are in a different era.
I have previously expressed certain dissatisfaction as to how masters etc. behaved, and I can’t see a reason to eradicate the contents of a discussion just because forty years on we are trying to change the way persons operate - again, even with the best intention.
If we were to have dear Kevin Boland in the room we might all f*cking well hear and learn a thing; I for one am not happy to censor thoughts and opinions in a private group.  This is great therapy, learning, closure, and we all have a common valency of bond that was forged in different times.</p></div>

It started off with a few of us getting there early on those properly cold and icy mornings when one could hardly feel their feet and skidding down the hill. The grounds man got involved and agreed to get the hose and pour gallons of water down the strip to create the water shoot. It quickly became early morning carnage with multi runs of us sliding at ridiculous speeds down the ice creating jumps and obstacles to make the runs harder and more dangerous. Until someone smashed there head flipping backwards on the ice…was it all over..hell no. It was agreed we would roll the scarfs on our heads to make crash helmets so we could carry on!!! Still makes me smile every time I think back at it!  😁 ‎<This message was edited></p></div>

Second years used to leave Saturday evening films early, ambush us and push us into gorse bushes. I remember one guy literally being swung by his arms and ankles over the bank by the all weather hockey pitch. 
I still can't walk past a gorse bush without checking for an ambush ... possible PTSD.

My Daughter for some reason wanted to go to a boarding school, I suppose she was lucky in that the perfect who she "fagged for" did not ask her to do anything for her, she did not have to do the usual, make the bed, clean the room carry her bag etc etc and hence when my Daughter got to 6th form she mirrord the behaviour of who she fagged for and asked nothing from her Fag, and I would like to think that cycle continued</p></div>

I suspect that when Rodney Exton left and Tyson took over the whole thing probably descended into chaos behind the scenes. We might not have been able to discern that at the time. I feel sorry for my parents shelling out good cash for that. I pay good money for my (13yo) daughter’s education and I damned well get something that transcends the academic instruction I had there - the sport is better too, but that’s another story.  On one hand I am a touch proud to have had a public school education, but I did feel that it was oddly ‘awkward’; I get the feeling that this is what a few of us felt - speaking candidly, I am clutching on to the thought that we all actually have a common bond that might run comfortingly deeper than we know.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>LOVE this ! What is crystal clear to me is that when we got to the 6th form, we broke the bullying cycle. That has been clear talking to teachers (not Masters !!!) after we left. I think the best measure of that is how many - who were a year or two below - have always echoed that sentiment and been good friends so I think we can hold our heads high and give ourselves a collective pat on the back !!!</p><p>Nick @447305534304 - I totally get where you are coming from re your experience with Ian Organ. Mine was Nick “the animal” Taylor.  Having been right royally pummelled black and blue for “looking at him in the wrong way” - bearing in mind he was 16 and I was 12 - I promised myself that one day, …just one day…I felt cheated in that I found out a couple of years ago he died in a car accident in his 20s. Maybe there is a God @447305534304!!! That is a truly appalling thing for me to type. Sorry in advance. But it’s cathartic. Nick said it way better. It’s the only grudge I have ever held - and it ran very deep !!!</p><p>On a more “positive” and entertaining point - yet again I was on the wrong side of a pummelling ! Someone - a year above - can’t remember his name - beat up Pixie. I objected to that so I biffed him quite hard. Unfortunately his buddy - let’s just call him “mad dog” -  came in our dorm at 11.30 one night and ambushed me. Public thanks to Fred Shawkat @447786337137 for pulling him off me. I was black and blue and the next day was Sports Day. My folks were over from the Middle East. My old man was not one to mess with (think Jason Leonard). I only just managed to stop my folks from piling into Tyson’s office.  “Mad-dog” and I now laugh about it, and I would differentiate from the previous “incident” where I probably deserved what I got and it was “even” match. Heaven knows how many times we had to dig ourselves  out of a situation Pixie got us in 😂😂😂 And we loved it ! 😘</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>I, and I don’t suspect I’m alone in this, have had a mixed and varied relationship with my past at boarding schools. At times Reed’s was the making or the breaking of me. Often both at the same time.</p><p>I left after o levels more because I wanted to make friends locally, and meet girls too. Being a boarder and far from school meant for long lonely holidays, along with the odd scrap with the local school kids. I did have Geoffrey trying to persuade me to stay, with some entertaining offers, but my mind was made up and I enjoyed two great years at 6th form.</p><p>However that did not mean I did not enjoy my time at Reed’s. The camaraderie, as can be witnessed by this thread (Thanks again Finchie) the sports, music and facilities we had on tap and unsupervised at weekends. It also got a lot easier as you ascended the years too. 
There was bullying but I can’t say that has stayed with me but I expect I got away better than some.</p><p>All in all I think I gained more than I lost.</p><p>From an academic point I didn’t do too bad with 8 O levels, no A grades though. What did help me get those was Prep and Late Prep. After all there’s only so much time you can spend in classroom each evening before you may as am do your homework. At college I had non of those, as my results will attest. Forget education was not for me.</p><p>Hunger is a memory from school, the constant yearning for any food. 
As a 3rd year I also remember crushing homesickness in the first few weeks and being unable to call home from that crappy phone booth by the changing rooms. Just get to the front of the queue only to be dished by 4th and 5th years. That passed and soon I would dread the end of term instead😳</p><p>It’s s peculiar world, that of a border in the 70s ands 80s</p></div>

Talking of musical memories:
One long Sunday arvo back in 1981, bored to feck, lying on my bed in the 5th form dorm you must have felt I needed a lift. You came over, gave me your Walkman and said listen to this. It was Heaven 17 - Penthouse and Pavement. I lay there and listened to the whole album. 40+ minutes of genius. Never forgotten that generosity. Ta much! Tx</p></div>

I remember them getting strewn around the woods as well. But I'm pretty sure I've got the negative of that shot and probably a bunch of others, I need to dig through some boxes.

        <div class="content"><p>Okay, this might be slightly embarrassing, but you all know I had a bit of a thing for heavy rock, I must say I pretty much ignored that from 1984 to 2016(!) however, I bumped into a huge Glaswegian at a party down here in Hampshire, and we decided to put together a heavy rock band. This is the band, Stryke, and it’s our version of slither by velvet revolver. If you get bored of it in the early stages, there’s a good solo by Paul at 2’50”. We’d be happy to play at the reunion. https://youtu.be/plm6L9SHKMo?si=OxCh3tbfSy2z-AI4</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Guilty as charged. Also for spending hours removing copy protection from titles on cassette tapes! I remember one winter's evening I'd played so much Pacman (or whatever the BBC clone of it was called) that when I walked out into the alleyway exiting the math lab I was faced with a residual image of a red ghost, approx 10 feet tall and plain as day. Think there was something about the food additives in the sweets from the tuck shop in those days that perhaps also had something to do with it...</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>The record that changed the world for a few people in my circle. I did two UK tours with Bam as support DJ, my friend Dapo was his manager in Europe at the time so he tapped me for it. Those were some mad times, but the biggest moment was actually when he didn't turn up. This was a thing with him, he would have stuff going on in Brooklyn and just wouldn't get on a flight until days after his first booking was meant to be, used to drive Dapo nuts. So I got to play the headline slot at the Heavenly Social at Turnmills, packed night, still a queue round the corner at 1am. I wondered how many out of the 1500 or so in the venue came away wondering if Bambaataa was a skinny white boy 😉</p></div>

Some teachers names I don’t recall from this chat, I don’t even remember the art teacher’s name.

        <div class="content"><p>Well remembered Finchie.
When he left Mr Williams replaced him. I did A level art with him. He was a useless teacher and a lazy fecker. He kept bunking off from teaching us to see his girlfriend in London. He asked us to cover for him each time but after a couple of terms we just said to Prince, when he put his head into the art studio, that he was in London.  He was sacked the next week.
His idea of teaching art was to say cut out a picture you like from a magazine, draw a grid over it scale it up and copy it.
Peter Thomas was a friend of Mr Prince and stood in for the last two terms and saved us all from certain failure.
Taught us to sculpt, screen print, throw pots; paint with oil, gouache and water colour and draw with conte, pastel and charcoal. Still life, life classes and from nature.
Without the A for art A Level I wouldn't have got to uni. Whoever employed Mr Williams should've been sacked too.</p><p>Still in touch with Peter. He lives in the Dordogne and exhibits in London each year. Lovely guy.</p><p>In the studio we (Rob Lee, James G, Joe Moreton and Joe Chan, & Mrs Martin!) listened to Fleetwood Mac - Rumours, Rickie Lee Jones and Van Morrison - Astral Weeks, drank a lot of tea and dyed our hair with peroxide. Good times.</p></div>

We used to sleep on the beach too and get hosed down by the street cleaners at 3 am... not sure who I was with, might even have been with other people after school...Got a rifle pointed at us as we would try our luck (again at night)under the concrete awnings of the private beach clubs, and the guard would try and scare us off.. And of course I remember Talking Heads. We went a filmed Wembley concert... not the Stop Making Sense film..</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Yes indeed, but not in any big or professional way. Something I've enjoyed doing though since being a kid with a 126 instamatic. Goes in fits and starts a bit, had a fallow period around lockdown but carrying a camera a lot more again now. Still have a lot of film gear but a long time now since I used it. Fuji X series cameras handle pretty much like the old school kit which is nice. Re faces I'm dreadful, found out a few years back there is a condition known as face -blindness, think I must have it, can be very embarrassing. Some randomly stick but more often not, please everyone cut me slack at the reunion if I don't clock who you are 🙏🏻</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Hello all, I'm currently completing a coaching course and need to build my hours / experience. Does anyone fancy a bit of coaching? No preparation is required on your part and it can involve any aspect of your life, just something you want to work through to get the outcome you're looking for. Lots of people approach coaching without a defined objective, so don't worry if you don't have a burning issue; I just need eager participants and thought this could be a user friendly place to start and a nice way to get to know each other again. All in strictest confidence of course. All on zoom so not logistical headaches. Please just message me on 07710742347 if you're interested and I'll let you know more, g.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>If you read the book, one trick that active fund managers do, is to shutdown underperforming funds, so it always looks like they are beating the market. Also, high return requires high risk, low return comes from low risk, but if you average the saw tooth of high returns over economic cycles, you find that the overall returns are similar often. So, why stress yourself.</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Another point to consider is that a reasonable return on an investment (after all expenses and taxes) over decades might be 4%. A typically active fund manager charges at least 1%. So, you are losing 25% of your profits right there before you even get out of the gate. ‎<This message was edited></p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>The book details many examples from the last 100 years about "outperforming the index". It's an interesting read.
Absolutely. Investment should be about long term, which means compound interest, so losing 25% of profits every year, is devastating to compound interest. And tax management is also critical as you mention. Compound interest in a "tax-free" account is a beautiful thing and makes a big difference.</p></div>

It was anyone who was part of the class that eventually left in 6 two (A level year) in 1984. i.e. who were any part of the journey with that year group. Seemed to make the most sense. 
Take the example of Garfield Hatton who may have left in ‘81. There is no incentive for him to go to the ‘81 reunion as that would be mostly the six formers 3 or 4 years older than him. No one to share experience and memories with. So he should be part of the Class of ‘84, as are you !!! Make sense ? 😀 ‎<This message was edited></p></div>

The basics were still there but everything was obviously upgraded. However it seems to have gotten smaller. How much land did they sell off in the interim?</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>They had a great time still keep in touch with many of their peers 7 & 5 years on. Mind you I may be in the minority on this chat but I had a great time (maybe shit exam results) with all the sport and some good mates several of whom I’m still in contact with. I think our era at any boarding school was challenging with physical discipline still acceptable and antiestablishment youths creeping in. Having worked there and another school for 14 years treating sports injuries it’s a whole new world these days with better facilities and teachers.  Just costs a fortune to go so the foundation side at Reeds makes it possible for quite a few more to get the experience & brings a little exposure to the privileged too of others not so fortunate 🤗</p></div>

As an OR who attended the School sometime during his tenure between 1971 and 2003, I am sure that you will have come across Mr Hearle who was, by all accounts, a larger than life character!</p><p>I was very touched to have just received a note from his son, Nick, in which he explained that Eric had been managing to live with cancer for some time but, at the end, it all happened very quickly.</p><p>Nick has kindly agreed to keep me updated which I will share as appropriate.</p><p>Should you wish to write to the family, please do let me know.

Amazing how often the school has come up over the years in discussion with clients and friends…so never forgotten, even though I would undoubtedly struggle to name even Capellites in our year now (apart from you Duncan of course!!).
Not exactly sure who’s in this space as more numbers than names but looks like Mark has been busy. 
I live down in Chichester now and am easily persuaded to imbibe ale if you’re ever in the area

On the Saturday drinking front, Alex’s tap bar sounds great, but I am a little worried about my creature comforts… I’m a fat old man and need a comfy chair! Looking at getting a room at the Woodlands unless anyone has any other recommendations?</p></div>

He is sedated due to the ventilator but is stable. They were hoping to remove the ventilator yesterday but he wasn’t quite ready, it’s a bit of a waiting game. But my view is that whilst he is very unwell, the doctors are quite positive. 
I will try to coordinate a visit with her but visitation is highly restricted. I will will update you when we know more 🙏🏻</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>I went to see Wolfie’s sister, Debbie, yesterday, and helped her celebrate her birthday and pass on all your best wishes to Neil. Wolfie would be proud of our hangovers and it was great release value for Debbie in these very difficult times.</p><p>I also visited Wolfie today at the ICU and he is under heavy sedation to support his ventilation, and while he seems stable he is in ICU for a reason, so still on 24 watch. The unit prefers to restrict visitors outside family, however, even under sedation, apparently he can hear who is in the room. So I passed on your best wishes and updated him on all the various messages regarding the forthcoming reunion.  I will regularly check in with Debbie and will keep you all updated if there are any majors changes.

        <div class="content"><p>Just come back for seeing Wolfie at Kingston Hospital as he is now out of ITU and currently resident in Hammel Ward, Esher Wing. While clearly not out of the woods, he seems to be on the long road to recovery and wanted to thank you for all your best wishes, he was really touched! He is also bloody determined to try and make it on the 30th, so Finchie, not sure you can have a word to ensure there is a spare space if he can?…his mobile phone is currently not working, so hasn’t responded on the WhatsApp Group recently, but hopes to do so soon! He thinks they might discharge him by end of week, however, if you are in Kingston and have time to visit, I am sure he would appreciate it. Visitation is 8-8, and if you do go, he would probably appreciate chocolate biscuits and a Sun Newspaper, as you can’t seem to buy them on site. He has an enough for a couple of days after my visit! I am off to France for the next few weeks, but will catch up with him on my return….That’s all from me for now…looking forward to seeing many of you either on 29th evening at Alex’s Brewery in Claygate or at the Reeds Lunch on 30th…cheers….D ‎<This message was edited></p></div>

My address is 91, Arundel Road, Kingston, Surrey, KT1 3RY. Closest Rail station is Norbiton. If anyone else is stuck for somewhere to stay, we still have floor space for blowup mattress and sleeping bag, or negotiate with others to go top to tail and every bed is a double! 🤠…</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Gentlemen - really looking forward to seeing so many of you on Saturday evening/Sunday, and looking forward to travelling up from Exeter to see you all. In advance of this weekend please can I say that I have been to a single school reunion (Rome) event about 10 years ago and have not done a lot of thinking about school for most of the past 40 years (not because of some repressed trauma - I don’t think! - but just because life has intervened). Since I can barely remember what I was doing 40 days ago I apologise in advance if I can’t remember the joyful/awful/embarrassing things that we might have got up to - however it’s me, not you 😳😳😂😂</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>Greetings from Bali 😊🙏. Enjoy Gents 👍. Am sure it will be a very enjoyable and nostalgic weekend. Are there actually still any Masters alive from 40 years ago! I have positive memories of Alan King, Basil G, Mr Proctor & Mr Warnock. Nicky Heather was ok, although responsible for interrogation techniques that the CIA would be proud of, resulting in 6 of the finest administered by Basil! Also remember Mr Stedman, who I sat next to in the school orchestra. Always smelt of alcohol for evening practice (no euphemisms intended 🤣). There’s really no one who had a detrimental effect on my future life, so please pass my best to any you run into. Look forward to seeing some of you in October. Cheers.</p></div>
