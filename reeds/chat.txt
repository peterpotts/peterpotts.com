[8/28/23, 9:37:49 AM] Mark Finch: I’ll catch up Nick Carey and Steve Gates up when they join !! 
But just wanted to kick this off before many return to the work week !! …
[8/28/23, 9:39:20 AM] Mark Finch: Hi ORs - the leavers of ‘84 (and anyone who was part of that year group at any point in time !!!!). 

As many of the very recent connections know, next year is our 40th anniversary for many of our year group (longer for some, but I want to include anyone who was in our year at any time !). For all my older connections - hopefully you don’t mind me assuming you’re up for it ?! 😂

Reeds always focus their reunions on the years who have the 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th etc anniversary’s - so next year it’s our turn 😀 30th June 2024. SAVE THE DATE !!

And unlike my O-levels and A-levels I haven’t left it to the last minute, but planning ahead !

It has been a lot of fun tracking you all down and catching up briefly and I’m delighted everyone has been keen to supply mobiles and connect via WhatsApp ! (So far !!). 

Happy Bank Holiday for those in the UK !
But there are a handful what are not in the UK !! Roger Attwell (USA), Joe Chan (Toronto), Jeremy Chipchase (Australia - chasing him for his number ), Malcolm MacDonald (Isle of Man, probably counts ?), Simon-Piers O’Mahoney (Transylvania), Peter Potts (California).

A few things to do over the next weeks and months. 
#1 if you can spare a paragraph or two, it would be superb to catch up on your journey ! 
#2 let me know if you have any connections that aren’t on here and would love to add (for our “year group” !!!)….
[8/28/23, 9:42:12 AM] Mark Finch: So here is my brief update:-

Following A level retakes at Guildford Tech 😂 went to Kingston Poly doing Computer Science, so naturally went onto the software industry. I‘ve lived in Liphook, Hampshire, for the last 20+ years. Still working in software (for a few more years yet !). Happily (in case she reads this) married to Jo with 3 kids, Tom (28), Emily (27), and Ollie (19).
I spend my leisure time in Lycra - mountain bike riding and road riding - with the only focus as the hydration at the end 😻

I kept in touch with Andy Shiells after leaving and over the years we windsurfed, played rugby, and cricket (when he was desperate) and exchanged “best men” duties. Then Dave Edwards as we coached mini rugby at ORs. Then latterly Andy Glass, Pixie and Dave Wilkinson (just missing Pascal Shaw’s golfing debut a few years ago). Pete Griffin joined us golfing one year. Also at the odd event seen Adam Bailey (I think he counts - just), Wolfie Smith and Mark Reid !
Catching up with Chris and Barry on occasion over the years. And about 20 years ago, Nick Carey, John Vocking, Gus Finney for a few beers in London !! Plus Jeremy Chipchase came to a fundraiser in the early noughties ! Only a couple of years ago a long chat with Nev Stevens !
Also connected with a handful on Facebook which has been superb seeing photos etc !

Bizarrely I still have a connection to Reeds as my brother-in-law, Clappie, still teaches there as does my nephew “Clappie Junior”. Jo’s sister Clare is married to Clappie. That’s a story for over a beer !

Looking forward to everyone’s updates !!!!
[8/28/23, 3:36:08 PM] Andrew Shiells: Just to summarise as Finchy’s speeches tend to go on there is a reunion that we all have to attend and share chats!! 🤗
[8/28/23, 7:19:28 PM] William Pendered: Pixie here. Well done Finchie for setting this up and great to see everyone next year. I'm actually in Oz right now, so if you happen to get Jerry's number or contact details, please share
[8/28/23, 7:27:28 PM] Peter Potts: Hey there, long-lost comrades!

Can you believe it's been 40 years? It's like we blinked and here we are, with life's journey etching its storylines onto our faces.✨

Since those unforgettable school days, my path has been quite the adventure. I dove deep into the world of computing, earning a PhD that unlocked a universe of possibilities. 🖥️📚

Over two decades ago, I took a leap of faith and founded a company in the heart of London, watching it grow and thrive.

But the call of the wild beckoned, and I found myself in Canada, chasing the allure of pristine landscapes and endless outdoor escapades. The Great White North became a second home, with a Peruvian love by my side and a Canadian daughter named Sabrina, who's added a new dimension of joy to my life. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Eventually, I found myself drawn to the tech mecca of Silicon Valley, where the sun always shines and innovation fills the air. Kayaking, hiking, and running became my sanctuaries, helping balance out my array of nerdy hobbies that I've proudly held onto all these years. 🚣‍♂️🏃‍♂️📚

And guess what's on the horizon? Retirement is peeking around the corner, with plans to embrace the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas. 🎰

Can't wait to hear all your stories of the last four decades. Here's to old memories and new beginnings! 🥂👋 #TimelessConnections #40YearsAndCounting

Peter Potts
[8/28/23, 8:08:33 PM] William Pendered: Hi Peter 👋
[8/28/23, 8:17:10 PM] Peter Potts: Hi Pixie, Must be lunchtime for you. Everybody in the UK is asleep.
[8/28/23, 8:23:46 PM] William Pendered: As for me, well I played rugby a few years for the ORs whilst at Oxford Poly with Andy Glass. Then became an Accountant and worked in London for 10 years in banking. Married to Mitch with  Ruby 23 and Joey 22. Moved out of London to Devon working in Pharma for 5 years before relocating to Switzerland for the past 12 years. Feel very privileged to have that opportunity as it is a great lifestyle on our doorstep. Now working on/off as a consultant, but trying to be more off nowadays and hoping to step away from the workplace, most likely not in Switzerland.
Keeping up to date with Andy G & S, Mark, Dave, Pascal, Barry. Looking forward to reuniting with you other lads. We should make a weekend of it 😀
[8/28/23, 8:26:10 PM] William Pendered: Yes lunchtime here Pete. On one of my breaks touring east coast Oz in Campervan. Just off magnetic Island heading to Airlie Beach. Previously with my kids in Thailand and full moon party 🍻🎊🏖️ guess some would say I've still not grown up 😂
[8/28/23, 8:36:29 PM] Peter Potts: Sounds like a really awesome holiday. Have great break. Hopefully, I'll make the reunion.

[8/28/23, 11:46:09 PM] Andrew Marsh: Thanks Mark - 40 years since anybody called me Sid - happy days
[8/29/23, 12:07:55 AM] James Eason: For me: I stumbled through A levels and rather than Uni I headed off to the city and was a Lloyd’s broker for a few years (that’s where I bumped into Andy Marsh and we’ve remained in touch and get together now and again). Late 90s I had a spell living in Bermuda working in Risk Management, and returned to continue that in ‘98. Work-wise since then I have concentrated on risk and crisis management and spent eight years up until 2019 as a kidnap and hostage responder; work that has enabled me to travel a fair amount, work with some interesting people, and get some kicks. While living in London I met my wife Frances (while playing for Battersea Wanderers) and we have a daughter Eleanor (14) who is at Millfield and playing hockey, cricket and netball for Somerset. We. We now live in Hampshire and I continue umpiring hockey as the lockdown weight incurred won’t shift itself, I also play in heavy rock band which I formed back in 2015 and we gig a bit - it’s just that finding the venues that’ll have us and the volume is the tough bit. There, it’s always just the good stuff, eh; rather than some of the dreadful sh*t we have had to soldier though during our lives!!!
[8/29/23, 12:35:44 AM] Andrew Marsh: 👍
[8/29/23, 12:52:36 AM] Mark Finch: Welcome Rob Lee (thanks Pascally Waly-Waly!😀)
[8/29/23, 1:15:44 AM] Giles Solomon: Hey Guys! Giles (Solomon) here. Living the dream on the Sunshine Coast of Australia and hanging sports-related shit on the Aussies at every opportunity! Great to be reconnected with you. Will wait for others to be added to the group and share my life history at that time. Couple of sentences should do it! Cheers.
[8/29/23, 2:01:53 AM] Peter Milne: Hey All! So many familiar names and so many years gone by! Great to be connected, and thanks @447917428535 for setting this up. I didn't make it to Reeds sixth form as the family were set to relocate to NZ. I crammed my A levels in a year at Guilford Tech and then the move fell through!!(long story!) Anyway I ended up at North Staffordshire Poly taking French and International Relations and then a PGCE at Leeds Uni.

After 14 months of backpacking around the world, I started my first teaching job in Addlestone. I then taught 4 years in Penang, Malaysia where I met and married my Malaysian wife, Adeline. Did a lot of sport there, including competition rugby and hockey. 

We moved back to Brighton where both my daughter Keomi(19) and my son Johan(18) were born. Got a teaching job in Dubai and ended up there for 10 years. Came back to the UK 8 years ago and set up my Educational Consultancy company which supports schools globally on Climate change and Sustainability education. 40 years in the blink of an eye😀.
[8/29/23, 2:07:39 AM] Giles Solomon: Hey Peter. I still remember tackling you in a rugby match. You were very tall and bloody fast! I ended up flying into the bushes on impact but prevented a certain try and that tackle got me promoted to the Thirds 🤣. Happy Days 😂.
[8/29/23, 2:14:41 AM] Pascal: Was next door at Keele....The Potteries, what a place! 😂
[8/29/23, 2:16:06 AM] Peter Milne: Happy days. My rugby journey finished when a massive Malay guy used me as hammer throw practice in a 7s match in KL!
[8/29/23, 2:24:50 AM] Peter Milne: Loved it there. When I first heard the local accent, I thought they were Russian!
[8/29/23, 2:33:30 AM] Peter Milne: Life is certainly a roller coaster! I also live in Hampshire😀. Lymington. We go even further back to Moleside School, right?
[8/29/23, 2:34:22 AM] James Eason: Yes! When we were three or four years old.
[8/29/23, 2:34:44 AM] Peter Milne: OMG!
[8/29/23, 2:35:21 AM] Malcolm: Malcolm here, as you all will most probably remember I did not quite make it to 5th form to sit my O'levels, Reeds and Basil Green in particular made it clear that I was not welcome back. I ended up sitting my O'Levels at Heathside and then did a year at Brooklands Tech before I realised education and I were not good bed fellows. I left the UK in 1984 on what I thought would be a two year working holiday in South Africa and started working in Insurance. Married, now happily divorced I have a 32 year old Daughter (Kaylee) and two grandchildren  (Odin 5 and Lexi 2 or Thor,as I prefer to call her). I stayed in SA till 2000 when I returned to the UK, still in Insurance I lived in Staffordshire until 2021 when I got offered a job on the Isle of Man that was too good to turn down. Very happy on this little island until we are invaded by bikers for TT.  I still turn out for the local cricket team, specialist drinker and chairman of the fines committee are my strong points. Nice to see so many familiar names here.
[8/29/23, 2:39:27 AM] Malcolm: Ps well done @447917428535  for setting this up
[8/29/23, 2:56:51 AM] S-P: I was there too - more than half a century ago!
[8/29/23, 2:57:25 AM] James Eason: I have the photos.
[8/29/23, 2:57:36 AM] S-P: Seriously!?
[8/29/23, 2:57:51 AM] Peter Milne: S-P you haven't changed a bit🤣
[8/29/23, 2:58:37 AM] S-P: Thank you - is that a compliment? I used to be quite nerdy, but I hope that phase passed a few years back 🙀
[8/29/23, 3:00:29 AM] Peter Milne: A compliment, as I can still recognise you. What are you doing in Romania?
[8/29/23, 3:01:14 AM] S-P: Thank you!!!!
[8/29/23, 3:01:19 AM] James Eason: Yes, i’ll dig out a couple and send through some shots when I get back home.
[8/29/23, 3:35:09 AM] Nick Carey: Jesus Sid, if that’s a recent photo you must have a dodgy painting in the attic!
[8/29/23, 3:35:47 AM] Nick Carey: Hi all, lots of memories flooding back!
[8/29/23, 3:39:25 AM] Andrew Marsh: It’s all down to a strict regime of clean living, regular exercise and no alcohol !!!!

[8/29/23, 4:31:26 AM] S-P: Well, after catching the international travel bug from trips to Hong Kong & Malaysia to visit Joe, Perry & Rob, I’ve been unstoppable: Engineering degree at Loughborough, then 11y at British Airways in their golden years, moved to Budapest for 9y, learned Hungarian, married a Hungarian from Transylvania, became Irish & joined the Irish Embassy, then some years as Director of the national airline, Malév, before the govt gave it away to an oligarch family! Moved to Vienna for a couple of years then Transylvania in 2010, many years involved with Microfinance there + Serbia + Kenya. Now Regional Director & Group Marketing Director at ATG from Ireland. We have 3 kids: Ákos 16, Tóla 14, Niamh 4. I think I might be able to claim the spot as the father of the youngest kid in this group?
[8/29/23, 4:34:56 AM] Peter Milne: That is quite a journey you have been on!
[8/29/23, 4:37:52 AM] Giles Solomon: Awesome haircuts!

[8/29/23, 6:07:27 AM] William Pendered: So great to hear from all you guys and hear your journeys
[8/29/23, 6:25:37 AM] Jo Chan: I’m good. How the heck r u? Love to hear ya stories, please include some juicy details.
[8/29/23, 7:31:02 AM] Nick Carey: 40 years in one paragraph Finchie? 🧐

Scraped in to Brighton Poly to do an engineering course I was totally unsuited to, but had the time of my life, mostly playing rugby and a bit of cricket. Kept the rugby (just local 3rds stuff) going into my mid 30’s… stayed down in Brighton/Hove for about 10 yrs, accidentally finding myself in sales (software then telecoms). 

After a few ups and downs, geographically (lived in Surrey, Brighton, Sheffield, Oxford, London, Manchester, Newbury, as well as looking after the Nordics for few years) and metaphorically (couple of awkwardly timed redundancies) I finally decided on a gentler work/life balance when I joined the OS about 10 yrs ago. 

Found my soul mate (Wendy) on the 2nd time of asking and just celebrated the 20th anniversary of our 1st date. One boy (Robbie 28) and one stepdaughter (Saskia 25) both thankfully moved out (I won’t say grown up!), and we’re now settled just outside Portsmouth. 

Spent most of my money on beer, rugby and sailing… the rest of it I wasted 😁
[8/29/23, 8:06:39 AM] Guy Finney: Hi All another Brighton Poly alumni where I had a great time and scrapped a 2 2 but did get friendly with a local bar maid! Made my way into accountancy and after a couple of years in the Bahamas decided to go into insurance of all things! Got married got divorced and have 4 great kids that I am trying to get out of the house mixed success one gone (but talking of coming back) one established working and living with me, one at uni and my son just done his A levels and going to do a Gap year. Been in Surrey for the last 25 years. Sitting on holiday in Turkey another story 😀
[8/29/23, 8:31:55 AM] Peter Milne: My son starts there next month to take Finance. They have a really cool new campus at Moulescomb.
[8/29/23, 8:37:52 AM] Guy Finney: Nick will know what I mean when I say hope the Ship pub has cleaned up its act and become more pc.
[8/29/23, 8:39:00 AM] Nick Carey: Well, maybe just higher quality? 😳
[8/29/23, 8:39:35 AM] Guy Finney: And just for clarity that is not where I met the bar maid!
[8/29/23, 8:40:13 AM] Nick Carey: Just had a look at streetview - it’s almost unrecognisable! Not sure if the Ship’s even there any more!

[8/29/23, 8:44:03 AM] Guy Finney: Bit like snake bite and black probably progress
[8/29/23, 8:45:18 AM] Roger Attwell: Good afternoon Gentlemen ( well almost afternoon here) 

When Finchie first contacted me about this plan he kindly reminded me of an old nickname relating to my haircut….” Bumhead” and I assured him I had an old school picture somewhere, after Giles mentioned our awesome haircuts back in the day I spent a couple of hours digging through old boxes of pictures and sure enough found it. Try to be kind with your comments……

[8/29/23, 8:46:30 AM] Nick Carey: Weston-super-mare! The pillow I had turned into an offensive weapon? That’s me! (Not as offensive as my hair!😳)
Ralston in the foreground? Great pic Jo!
[8/29/23, 8:50:22 AM] Nick Carey: Sid (sorry, must get used to calling you Andy!), is that you in the overalls (back to us) - can’t remember if you did Weston? (Will never forget orienteering in Germany though! 🤣)
[8/29/23, 8:59:45 AM] Andrew Marsh: Not sure - I think I am more likely to be the one on the bed trying to get some kip
[8/29/23, 9:00:45 AM] Mark Finch: Legendary !!!
[8/29/23, 9:01:20 AM] Mark Finch: Although that looks like you had spent some hours flattening it. I recall it grew upwards 😂

[8/29/23, 9:38:09 AM] Andrew Marsh: Hi Nick - I can remember orienteering in Germany - must have enjoyed it because I ended up joining the HAC and doing much the same (albeit as a weekend warrior) for the next 8 years.
[8/29/23, 9:42:45 AM] Jo Chan: Hey Roger. My first experience of over 100mph on the road woz in your dad’s Range Rover front passenger seat. It was more fun than Alton Tower roller coaster.
[8/29/23, 9:56:08 AM] Nick Carey: I hope you got better at reading maps lol - I remember it so well (apart from the sparkling company obvs!) because we were the only pair to get lost and got back an hour later than anybody else! 🤣
[8/29/23, 9:57:01 AM] Nick Carey: Ironic that I now work at OS 🤣
[8/29/23, 10:34:25 AM] Peter Potts: Interesting! I'm working at Apple Maps.
[8/29/23, 10:36:21 AM] Guy Finney: Peter why am I not surprised 😀
[8/29/23, 10:37:54 AM] Guy Finney: I remember your titration computer simulator all those years ago
[8/29/23, 10:38:12 AM] Mike Nunan: Wow what a turn-out! Great to see everyone here and read all the stories of what you've been up to the last decades. Well done Mark for getting this together, hat off to you mate.

For me a career in tech was always on the cards really so after spending three years studying computer systems in sunny Salford (basically an electronic engineering degree and probably not the perfect choice in hindsight) and graduating with a "Desmond" 2-2 it was straight into the software industry where I have remained since, although in my late 20s a career change into music was a serious consideration. I became a massive collector of a pretty broad range of vinyl, most of it dancable, and landed many DJ gigs of varying sizes mostly through the 90s-00s timeframe, although I have kept my hand in off and on right up to covid, which killed the nice bar in East Dulwich where I had a residency. Currently angling for another nice weekend spot in Cambridge, but let's see, it was much easier in London really.

Like you Nick it took me two goes to get it right in marriage but coming up to 10 years together now with my lovely Alexandra and couldn't be happier in my home life. I have a daughter who will be 17 in November and has just smashed her GCSEs out of the park. Distance means we don't spend all that much time together but it's quality over quantity and we have a great relationship.

Seems like you all are at it on the sports field, good on you for that - I'm sure you remember exactly how sports-averse I was in school (even Nicky "Sly" always saying how I never got mud on my knees on the rugby pitch!) but I did manage to get myself in shape a bit, with a few different martial arts and then latterly a few solid years of Crossfit. I even managed to put some muscle on, but it all went to pot during covid and I need to climb back in the saddle really.

Aside from music I'm still into the photography (and I must now dig out some old negs from school years which I do still have somewhere) and also a fairly serious-grade petrolhead. I'll take off to Wales or Scotland on a driving mission a few times a year.

Ok that's enough waffle for one message, I'll leave it there for now!

[8/29/23, 10:56:43 AM] Steve Gates: Oh wow - this has been such a wonderful group to hear from, thankyou @447917428535 for getting us together: I can barely remember 40 days ago and so it’s been so heartwarming to see a roll call of illustrious names that I recall so fondly from 40 years ago… It doesn’t seem possible it was 40 years ago 😂😂😂
[8/29/23, 11:05:12 AM] Steve Gates: I still remember your endless playing of Rush when we were in 6th form. I was talking to my training manager a couple of weeks ago (who’s also a lady of a “certain age”) about prog rock bands of our youth and had to admit to her that I actually ended up quite liking Rush and Geddy Lee, despite what I might have said at the time… 😂😂🙌
[8/29/23, 11:11:59 AM] Mike Nunan: hahaha yes! I've actually returned to listening to them, and have grabbed a couple of the anniversary vinyl releases (all I had were tapes of other people's copies back in the day) - they have gone through a sort of geek vindication in more recent years, there's even a halo documentary on Netflix - but when I discovered jazz fusion then I realised what my ears were really looking for in all that prog rock, Billy Cobham being the absolute god of the drum kit - saw him live in the mid 90s, absolutely incredible to watch him play with two sticks in each hand, what a master
[8/29/23, 11:12:45 AM] Steve Gates: In terms of my journey through life after going to Leeds Uni I ended up doing a variety of marketing jobs before making the “unusual” switch to becoming an MD at the age of 35. Have since run a number of companies in the health arena, most recently at BUPA, before moving to Devon in my current role as MD at Taking Care (the UK’s largest private provider of  personal alarms to the elderly, which is actually a lot more fun than it sounds… 😂😂😂) Celebrating 31 years of marriage to Karen this year (who I met at Uni) and blessed with two daughters (30 and 28 - Neo-natal intensive care nurse and police dispatcher: so a good public service balance to my nakedly commercial career 😎😎) and son (19 - at Aberystwyth Uni doing veterinary bioscience) AND two granddaughters. Three dogs and a habit of still attending hardcore dance raves when I can and we certainly all feel busy…. looking forward to catching up properly with everyone face-to-face
[8/29/23, 11:16:14 AM] Guy Finney: I need one of those alarms just to be sure after one or two gins on holiday in Turkey 😀
[8/29/23, 12:16:41 PM] Haydar Shawkat: Mark, thanks for getting us together. It’s great to hear everyone’s news. 40 years but the connection is there instantly! 
After Reeds I read Engineering at Bristol Uni where I also played rugby (badly but I enjoyed it and made lots of friends) until a back injury stopped me. These days I run, swim and cycle, slower as each year goes. I’ve been married to Denise for 27 years and we have two sons, Niall who turned 24 today (he is autistic) and Oliver who is reading Maths at Bath Uni.
After training as a Chartered Accountant at EY where I met Denise I worked in finance for a couple of international companies in the information business for some 20 years. I was fortunate enough to travel a lot with work and spent some time in the US and Turkey. These days I do voluntary and non-exec work. Looking forward to our reunion next year 😀.
[8/29/23, 12:23:22 PM] Steve Gates: We have GPS too so we can locate you when you’ve fallen in the bushes too…. On a similar note, what was the “run” that we had to do in the Close when we got thrown in the gorse bushes after Saturday night film up in the main school…? I’m sure that would be borderline illegal now 😂😂😂
[8/29/23, 12:45:14 PM] James Eason: I’ve still got your little green pen-knife you gave me. In retrospect I am unsure as to why you felt I needed to be tooled up in the fourth form but it’s still kept sharp!
‎[8/29/23, 12:50:25 PM] Jo Chan: ‎<attached: 00000118-PHOTO-2023-08-29-12-50-25.jpg>
[8/29/23, 12:55:11 PM] James Eason: Good grief I look rather disenfranchised! Maybe I was just appalled at Sprawson’s vulgarity!! Now, if HE could be located…..
[8/29/23, 1:01:54 PM] Peter Milne: Where the heck did you drag that up from??
[8/29/23, 1:02:35 PM] Jo Chan: From my image library archive.
[8/29/23, 1:03:23 PM] Peter Milne: That sounds like a scary place!
[8/29/23, 1:27:37 PM] Pascal: Sprawson....he pushed it all to the limit. My memory might be playing tricks but I remember some of us jumping out of that class window . Can't remember the name of the maths teacher, but she must have suffered a lot. I think we hid her handbag somewhere once or hid Sprawson in the class cupboard...
[8/29/23, 1:28:49 PM] John Vocking: Ma Holt?
[8/29/23, 1:29:30 PM] Pascal: The gorsing ritual....🙃
[8/29/23, 1:29:57 PM] James Eason: Yes, we would jump out the window run up the grass, touch the fence and get back in the window before she knew it. Can’t remember her name, but I recall that was she was oddly attractive in a weird way; but hey, when puberty hits, puberty hits.
[8/29/23, 1:29:59 PM] Pascal: Could be
[8/29/23, 1:30:32 PM] James Eason: Yes, we would jump out the window run up the grass, touch the fence and get back in the window before she knew it. Can’t remember her name, but I recall that was she was oddly attractive in a weird way; but hey, when puberty hits, puberty hits.
[8/29/23, 1:30:43 PM] Pascal: Oddly attractive....there was only the French teacher.
[8/29/23, 1:30:58 PM] John Vocking: Mrs or was it Miss Witherington was my nemesis 😳🤣
[8/29/23, 1:32:34 PM] Jo Chan: She woz cute even when she get angry
[8/29/23, 1:32:58 PM] Nick Carey: It’s probably supposed to be hush hush but you’ve got a bunch of our data in there 😁
[8/29/23, 1:33:51 PM] Peter Milne: It was Ma Holt and yes, she was very attractive for pubescent boys😉
[8/29/23, 1:34:19 PM] Pascal: Still have the stickers on it
[8/29/23, 1:34:44 PM] James Eason: I remember clearly the day that Mrs Witherington’s nipples came out to play.
[8/29/23, 1:35:21 PM] Pascal: Nope
[8/29/23, 1:35:43 PM] James Eason: I am a few gins in, so I will watch what I say!
[8/29/23, 1:36:09 PM] Pascal: Art and maths = apple maps
[8/29/23, 1:36:17 PM] Nick Carey: Miss Witheringtits! I sat at the front in physics just so I could look down her top! When I wanted to drop physics at o level, she told my parents it would be a terrible mistake as I was such a keen pupil! 🤣
[8/29/23, 1:36:38 PM] Pascal: Art and maths = apple maps
[8/29/23, 1:36:43 PM] John Vocking: The only detention i enjoyed was 3hrs in the quiet room with Miss Witherington watching over us.  It was chaos.
[8/29/23, 1:37:27 PM] Roger Attwell: She certainly was happy showing ample cleavage!
[8/29/23, 1:38:15 PM] Jo Chan: You have to declare your love ❤️ to her, after all these years.
[8/29/23, 1:38:50 PM] Pascal: 🤔
[8/29/23, 1:43:46 PM] Mark Finch: Yes !
[8/29/23, 1:52:49 PM] John Vocking: Left after O levels in 82. Remember that summer well travelling up to London with Tom Hardiment and Robert Lee. Going to the Vic and playing indoor hockey in the Gym,  also falling off the balcony backwards into crash mats!

After Reeds I went to Farnham 6th form college. But did return to Reed’s for a day to resit my English Level. Had two of my best years of education,  not of the academic sort though 😎.

Started work at the DHSS in 85 and after a brief but tragic stint as a photocopier salesman I then worked for Egon Ronay, the start of my waistline increasing. 

After that I started at BA in 1987 and stayed there for 13 years, meeting my wife and getting married in 1991. Then moved to a television company before that went bust and moved onto a program manger role with Sainsburys online operation. Then a stint at Sky before returning to BA as an IT project manager in 2005 where I remain. Plan to retire in 4 years, out at least do something different that I enjoy and has less pressure. 

Saw Dave at a Reed’s reunion day probably 20 years ago. Have social media contact with Pascal (Le Frog) Nick Carey, Jon Rigby, Shaun Gough and Nick Haigh.  Also bumped into a few when I was working in TV at Mortimer street. Wonder what happened to some people that have no web presence at all, Tom Hardiment and Paul(Willy) Rushton for example. Did bump into Paul at a tube station in the mid 80s, he was working in the city at the time. 

Still married, over 30 years now, and have two daughters, 30 and 27 and they have finally left home😁  . Live in Chertsey, and work at Heathrow, do a lot of travelling, perks of the job, but also cycle a lot and was playing Hockey up to about 7 years ago. 
Unlike AD, alcohol and too much of the bad things in life account for my less than youthful appearance. 

Turkey!
[8/29/23, 2:03:46 PM] Jo Chan: I'd like to start by thanking Mark for creating this amazing group—too many fond memories from our early days. The last time we were all together, Frankie goes to Hollywood was at the top of the chart while we all went different paths to discover life possibilities. Since art was my fav subject or the only subject I could pass without Perry or Simon passed me the exam answer. Manchester was my first stop after Reeds to learn design & how to drink beer(s). Then I came to explore Canada; a super chill place, the government has not kick me out…yet; may be they lost my address. Now living in downtown Toronto, diversity here is awesome. 

I'm a graphic designer, partnering with advertising agencies, providing creative solutions to solve their client's marketing problems, a fun proposition most of the time. A few years back, one of our client found Andy Glass, a fantastic photographer, then we both contribute to a project, from different country, small world indeed. Once in a blue mooooon, I connect with Simon Mahoney (O’Mahony now) and Perry Lim-Low.  

Married to Ivy, she said she will have kids when I grow up—still waiting. Off-hours, we like experiencing the food scene. Recently, I picked up electric skateboarding and living dangerously. Luckily, I'm still alive to write this message as a few years ago, a Tesla T-bone my face, no pun intended. Looking forward to c u all & share a few pints.
[8/29/23, 2:03:59 PM] Nick Carey: Good point about Tom - anyone seen hide or hair of him? I could’ve sworn Finchie said he’d reached Rob… Finchie?
[8/29/23, 2:07:47 PM] Mark Finch: Ah ha ! He has been added @61419192170 ! But on a different timezone - in Australia !
[8/29/23, 2:13:50 PM] William Pendered: Thought the same, what about Sprawson. Did he leave after the Close?
[8/29/23, 2:16:05 PM] James Eason: Yes I think so.
[8/29/23, 2:16:23 PM] Pascal: Thereabouts. What about the Dutch guy or was that Sprawson...? 🤯 getting brain ache from trying to decipher the past.
[8/29/23, 2:16:35 PM] William Pendered: Wasn't the other challenge to crawl to the front of class to see what color undies she had on ?
[8/29/23, 2:17:16 PM] Peter Milne: Hey Pixie. He would be an interesting one to track down. Yes, spot on with Ma Holt!
[8/29/23, 2:17:56 PM] Pascal: ‎This message was deleted.
[8/29/23, 2:19:59 PM] Peter Milne: Other names come to mind. Graham Rice, Jamie Moreton, Tom Dortch( the one who threw the rugby ball American style right across the other side of the pitch)
[8/29/23, 2:21:33 PM] John Vocking: Some memory triggers, Mullens biased

[8/29/23, 2:26:15 PM] William Pendered: Hi Pete 😁
‎[8/29/23, 2:27:42 PM] William Pendered: ‎<attached: 00000160-PHOTO-2023-08-29-14-27-42.jpg>
[8/29/23, 2:27:46 PM] Peter Milne: Hi Pixie. Great to be connected!😎
[8/29/23, 2:27:47 PM] Mark Finch: I remember Sprawson on his back - marine like - with a big frigging torch - reporting back 😂😂😂
[8/29/23, 2:34:09 PM] Mark Finch: And Dortches “dummy”, where did it a second time and dropped it into the arms of Pascal steaming in at number 8. A legendary move. In my head I was “wide receiver” but I bet it was Zaid Tuiama ! 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[8/29/23, 2:36:39 PM] Mark Finch: It’s dark here now Pixie ! Maybe tomorrow 😂
[8/29/23, 2:38:46 PM] Nick Carey: I have a feeling John Vocking was the target the first few times, before he ripped his ear off he played on the wing - John, am I dreaming ?
[8/29/23, 2:39:38 PM] Nick Carey: Graham was a pretty decent open side iirc
[8/29/23, 2:41:26 PM] John Vocking: You’re not dreaming Nick. 32 stitches in my right ear at Epsom A&E. Found out that the head bleeds a LOT.
[8/29/23, 2:42:53 PM] Nick Carey: I meant about being the wide receiver for Dortch’s American football bomb lol - I remember the blood all too well!
[8/29/23, 2:45:45 PM] John Vocking: Yes that was me on at least one occasion. Carried my appearances between the wing and Flanker.
[8/29/23, 2:47:11 PM] Nick Carey: That’s right! The original hybrid 😁 very in fashion right now
[8/29/23, 2:50:10 PM] Peter Milne: Can't remember, but I know we had a bloody good team!
[8/29/23, 2:51:15 PM] Roger Attwell: Zaid was pretty much unstoppable….. if he caught the pass!
[8/29/23, 2:53:06 PM] Nick Carey: Still remember his first training session on the range. They put him at prop coz of his size… caught the first kickoff and went in under the posts untouched
[8/29/23, 2:53:39 PM] Peter Milne: Very true. A Jonah Lomu of his time. Where is he now?
[8/29/23, 2:55:50 PM] John Vocking: He’s on Facebook
[8/29/23, 2:56:08 PM] John Vocking: Does some amazing artwork
[8/29/23, 3:32:08 PM] Mike Nunan: Graham Rice, such a nice guy, Nick Haigh too, anyone got a contact for him? Remember shooting the breeze about cars together in Basil's chemistry lab, probably why I got a C 😏
[8/29/23, 3:34:37 PM] William Pendered: You did well then Mike 🤣
[8/29/23, 3:46:06 PM] John Vocking: He’s on Facebook and LinkedIn., Mike. 
I seem to remember you cracking one of the best jokes in a Physics lesson. Can’t remember the teacher but he asked why transformers hum, to which you replied…”Because they don’t know the words Sir”🤣
[8/29/23, 9:17:47 PM] Kin: Wow, thanks so much for getting  me on to this group, Mark 

What a wonderful blast from the past appearing into the present ! 

So nice to catch up on what’s happening with all 

I got into Med School in Dublin 1986 and qualified as a doctor in 1991 

Did my intern in limerick and in 1992 went to the UK going from one hospital to another to eventually live in Inverness for a few years enjoying the wilderness of the Highlands 

In January 1998 on a freezing subzero morning , I left my life behind in Inverness and landed a few days later in Tasmania Australia 

Worked there for 18 months and then relocated to Western Australia where I became a ‘back pack doctor ‘ travelling from one hospital to another - I was up in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia a fair bit exposed to looking after the Aboriginals - fascinating culture of 40,000 years or so but sadly plagued by much drug and alcohol issues 

In 2001 , I eventually settled in the Southwest of Australia in a town called Busselton about 2.5 hours south of Perth. I’ve been a GP since 

Built a house here and in 2004 met my wife , Ly ( pronounced Lee)

Since, 5 children came to our lives and really been living the dream 

2 boys and 3 girls 
Ren, 16 - boy
Yin,  14- girl
Ting, 12- girl
Kai, 10- boy
Plum, 8- girl
[8/29/23, 9:20:03 PM] Kin: That was me , Rob 

Ps I have been in contact within Tom Hardiment a fair bit 

I’ve also been wanting to get in contact with Jerry Chipchase who I understand is an Obstetrician based in Adelaide, South Australia
[8/29/23, 9:20:46 PM] Kin: Tom’s no

+44 7952 310564
[8/29/23, 11:22:01 PM] Graham: ‎Mark Finch added Graham
[8/29/23, 11:22:19 PM] Mark Finch: Welcome Graham Rice !!!
[8/29/23, 11:25:30 PM] Mark Finch: It was my 31st Wedding Anniversary yesterday and I reckon Jo thinks I’m having an affair as I just kept looking at my phone and grinning inanely 😂😂😂
[8/29/23, 11:29:24 PM] Mark Finch: One thing that occurs to me - these are such great updates - late joiners will have missed a lot. I’m thinking of setting up a Google sheet with folks individual stories and sharing it on here and with the late joiners. Clearly there are lots of cleverer technology people on here - just want to check that would be the best way to catch people up (make sense @16504609902 and @447973187547 ?!!!).
[8/29/23, 11:46:56 PM] David Edwards: Wow!!! I wasn’t sure whether to read messages 1st or start to contribute, but similar to school…I can’t keep up, 🤪…so will go ahead and share my story…already amazing to hear your stories and see the pictures, crazy to think 40 years have passed! For me, as my house ‘The Griffin’ became the local smoking and coffee den, it became a major distraction from school life, so I was encouraged to find alternative places to expand the mind! 🤗…so after a couple of years at catering college I went off travelling for a couple of years that cemented my passion for being out and about.  I have lived in the Kingston Upon Thames area since 1988, which some might remember was a stock market crash and mortgage rates went to 16%!!! ….and I owned a house with my mate and brother from a different mother ‘Fozz’ (I am sure many of you will remember from the Vic)…but we survived hook or by crook and during that time I spend a lot of time drinking and partying with Pete Griffin and Neil Smith, and played rugby for Reeds under captain ship of Pix! It was in this time I married my life partner, Gaily, and we have 2 children ‘Georgie (30) a Yoga Teacher and Harry (27) running music events and promotions. I found myself a sales job for Philip Morris Cigarettes (that was still a passion of mine 😵‍💫) which led to sales at American Express which set my course for a career in payments, loyalty and finance. Over the years I have remained heavily involved with Reeds Rugby due to my son starting there at 4, and Finchie, Shiela and I spend many years coaching the boys. With the love of travel and I am fortunate to now only needing to work part time, Gaily and I have spend most of the last few years traveling in Campervans and Motorhomes in the far reaches of Europe….and with a combo of golf, rugby and beers, it’s been amazing to have life long friendships with several folks on this group…well done Finchie for setting this up, not sure you were expecting an avalanche though! 🤠
[8/29/23, 11:49:36 PM] David Edwards: Haha James, that is a great find. I think I have the same photo in the attic somewhere! 🙏🏻
[8/29/23, 11:59:31 PM] David Edwards: Great to hear from you Peter…I have so many fond memories of our junior years hanging around your house or cycling in Oxshott Woods! Your parents were the closet thing to an Auntie and Uncle, and I have very special memories of your dad, Ken, smoking his pipe on a Sunday afternoon in his lounge listening to classical music, walking the dogs with us and bringing back exotic fruits from his travels, he was the 1st person to intro us to Kiwi Fruit! Ironically my sister, Alison,  is with us at the moment, over from NZ, where she has lived for over 30 years and my other sister, Debbie, is over from Spain. We have all been reminiscing on how our families used to spend time with each other. Unfortunately, mum & dad (Norman & Margaret) are not with us anymore. How about Ken and Rosalind?…and Sandy (or is he Alexander now?)
[8/30/23, 12:04:12 AM] David Edwards: Great…can you make a version for Motorhomes! 🤠
[8/30/23, 12:04:27 AM] Mark Finch: Quick status update as this is work in progress !!! Folk I have a line out to …

[8/30/23, 12:27:41 AM] Nick Carey: Guy Wood sadly no longer with us I am afraid…
[8/30/23, 12:28:39 AM] David Edwards: 2 Grand daughters..Wow!
[8/30/23, 12:29:04 AM] Mark Finch: Oh Jesus.  Very sad. What happened Nick and when ?
[8/30/23, 12:32:56 AM] Nick Carey: Struggling to remember - it was probably more than 10 years ago and I wasn’t local at the time. I know he suffered from several chronic conditions but I don’t know what happened I am afraid…
[8/30/23, 12:35:02 AM] Mark Finch: Blimey ! I was optimistically thinking this is the year to do it as I didn’t think we had lost anyone (vs the 50th anniversary reunion !!!).
[8/30/23, 12:37:39 AM] David Edwards: RA…good to hear your voice! Still remember you taught me wisdom! You told me to punch you in the chin…the wisdom was I didn’t, as chose not to be pummelled afterwards 😂
[8/30/23, 12:48:49 AM] James Eason: And sadly Joe Statham passed a few years ago. I can’t recall the circumstances much but will have a think; I guess  we are much inclined to push these things to the back of our minds.
[8/30/23, 12:54:54 AM] Pascal: He had a chronic skin condition and asthma.
[8/30/23, 12:58:20 AM] Andrew Shiells: I think it was cancer that took Guy in the end not sure what type possibly blood 😔
[8/30/23, 1:08:14 AM] David Edwards: Great to hear from you…I took my Motorhome through Romania in May this year…loved it and will be back. Hopefully next time will catch up over a beer!
[8/30/23, 1:08:31 AM] Mark Finch: Welcome Tom Hardiment !!! I’ll ping you and other “late joiners” separately in the next couple of days with all the great stories and updates everyone has shared !!!! Which have been superb !!!
[8/30/23, 1:09:28 AM] Peter Milne: Great to hear from you, Dave. Lots of amazing memories shared between the families and Court House and The Griffin. My dad sadly passed away 6 months ago but my mum is doing well at 97, living with full time care in Putney. Sandy is all good. We were all up at Twickenham last week to watch All Blacks vs SA in honour of my dad. Not quite the right result😜
‎[8/30/23, 1:11:00 AM] Peter Milne: ‎<attached: 00000209-PHOTO-2023-08-30-01-11-00.jpg>
[8/30/23, 2:20:25 AM] Mike Nunan: I'll have a look on LinkedIn then (I'm a facebook-refuser) - and I'd forgotten all about that gag, thanks for the memory! 😂
[8/30/23, 2:22:58 AM] Mike Nunan: Great idea - probably a Google Doc rather than a sheet makes most sense I would've thought but either is good. It's one of the downsides of WhatsApp that you can grant permission for new group joiners to see the whole history (at least, I assume that is still a current restriction, might be worth a careful check of the options to confirm). Related to the end-to-end encryption perhaps, as there is no central server record of the messages. One of the many reasons I prefer Telegram but that's not as universal unfortunately.
[8/30/23, 2:24:36 AM] William Pendered: Think Andy G has Chris Brogden, or he is on chat Mark? I'm sure someone also had Phil Rushen, heard people talk of him last year or so?
[8/30/23, 2:28:16 AM] Mark Finch: Crispy Bacon is on here Pixie
[8/30/23, 2:29:10 AM] Chris: Hi all .. am here ... so good to hear from everyone. Will update later
[8/30/23, 2:33:07 AM] William Pendered: Mark, I am in contact Adam Bailey (email). But he was year above, unless he retook and officially left also in 84? Let me know if you want me to get his number
[8/30/23, 2:36:56 AM] Mark Finch: Yes, definately counting him as he retook with us in our last year. I think the same as Kieron Barry-Hawe and Neil (or Nick) Bond — The memory fades !
[8/30/23, 2:38:18 AM] Nick Carey: Nick’s in the States Mike, doing very well. Married for about 30 yrs now, 2 girls - one at or just graduated uni and the other just finishing high school I think. Finchie has reached out to him, so hopefully he’ll be along in a bit! 
Graham was a really nice guy, very quiet and mild mannered until he crossed the whitewash 😁
[8/30/23, 6:03:38 AM] Roger Attwell: Was it Chris Brogden that I remember breaking his arm trying to jump onto the wall outside the common room at the Close I just remember he created an extra joint between his wrist and elbow with the broken bone sticking out?
[8/30/23, 6:04:12 AM] Chris: Ha! Yes that was me... still got the scars ...
[8/30/23, 6:05:53 AM] Peter Milne: I remember that😜
[8/30/23, 6:07:56 AM] Mark Finch: I promise I never tried to pull you up using that arm !!
[8/30/23, 6:08:54 AM] S-P: Me too
[8/30/23, 7:36:17 AM] Jon R: ‎Mark Finch added Jon R
[8/30/23, 6:39:36 AM] S-P: Yes, it was leukemia.  I was in touch with him and his mum and dad til each passed away.  Remember those parties in their garage?  Lesley told me only a couple of years ago that the occasional checkin by a cop were a total setup - she had told us as teenagers that he was there due to complaints from the neighbours - all a fabrication.  He was a real cop but was not on duty!
[8/30/23, 6:42:38 AM] S-P: Oh boy......
[8/30/23, 6:43:48 AM] S-P: That's a cute one - we're about the same age as my daughter is now.
[8/30/23, 7:10:54 AM] James Eason: I think 7 in the first and 5 in the second; the first being ‘73
[8/30/23, 7:36:37 AM] Mark Finch: Welcome Jonny Rigby !!! 😀
[8/30/23, 7:39:31 AM] Jon R: Hi all. What a brilliant surprise, can’t say I saw this reconnect coming when I woke up this morning 😀🤚
[8/30/23, 8:22:03 AM] John Vocking: Guy was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. It’s a very treatable cancer but the treatment can leave you open to other ills. He received his first dose of Chemo and was in high spirits, however at the start of his second i believe he caught a respiratory illness and died suddenly. That was probably 10 years ago now. Very sad, he was a lovely chap that did a lot to help others.
[8/30/23, 8:28:49 AM] Steve Gates: That’s the bit that I remember 😂😂😂
[8/30/23, 10:47:34 AM] David Edwards: Ouch…I remember it in all it’s gory details! 😵‍💫
[8/30/23, 10:50:45 AM] David Edwards: Brilliant….please send our love!

[8/30/23, 11:09:54 AM] David Edwards: My lasting memory of Sandy is head banging at one of the School Concerts, which I am sure contributed to a lifetime of back issues 😂…I am sure many of you were there!
[8/30/23, 11:13:14 AM] Peter Milne: The band was called Crucifix and then Titan. They practised in the cellar, and there were always parties around the house. Ironic that he was the brother that went bald and became an Osteopath!
[8/30/23, 11:14:06 AM] David Edwards: 😂

[8/30/23, 2:18:23 PM] Graham: Thanks Finchie for persevering in connecting with me🙏. Unlike many of the ORs from our year who have stayed in touch over the years, this is the first time for me to be back in touch with you all. I never saw that coming either. Thanks for the great welcome.

My story in brief: After leaving Reeds I went to Bath University to study Materials Science (basically a course for those who can’t decide between the various science and engineering courses, and some would say the soft option 😉). Upon graduating from Bath in 1988, I was drawn North by the beauty of Scotland and worked for BP in Grangemouth. My future wife, Lynn and I met in my first weeks there (I had also joined the local rugby club and promptly broke a metatarsal bone in my foot, so I stood out somewhat as a new graduate on crutches with a stooky (Scottish for plaster-cast)). In the early years I spent most of my time mountaineering with a local club, and windsurfing and waterskiing on Loch Lomond. Lynn and I married in 1991 and then in 1992 we moved to Geneva with BP, to continue the mountaineering and windsurfing theme, but added skiing to the mix. Our son was born in Switzerland before BP closed the office there and we relocated to England in 1996. Our daughter was born soon after in England. After 25 years with BP and then Ineos, I transitioned from black to green to work in the wind power sector with Siemens, and am still in the wind industry now, but we have since moved back to Scotland (it’s just a truly magical place). Our kids are now 28 and 26 and both live and work in London. There seems to be less time for hill walking (although I do still get away occasionally). I am very involved in my local Church - I am on the leadership team and so most Sundays are taken up. Perhaps more unusually, I am an apiarist (i.e. a beekeeper) and I enjoy foraging (who doesn’t like free food) and I make stuff out of wood (usually that I have sliced up using a chain saw). 
Looking forward to catching up in person.😄
[8/30/23, 2:41:50 PM] Peter Milne: It's great to hear from you, Graham. Lots of great memories, and I am sorry we didn't manage to meet up in the New Forest when you were down here.
[8/31/23, 12:01:03 AM] Graham: Likewise Pete. Lots of threat memories and lots of catching up to do.
[8/31/23, 12:30:12 AM] Graham: # great memories 😆
[8/31/23, 12:45:47 AM] Giles Solomon: There were probably a few “threat” memories too 🤣. I know I have some!
[8/31/23, 1:53:58 AM] Peter Milne: That is a whole new WhatsApp chat right there🤪
‎[8/31/23, 2:41:35 AM] Mark Finch: ‎<attached: 00000245-PHOTO-2023-08-31-02-41-35.jpg>
[8/31/23, 3:05:16 AM] Mike Nunan: nice! looks like Soho, used to see him quite a lot around there, he'd come in the same barbershop (Cuts)
[8/31/23, 3:05:37 AM] Mike Nunan: very friendly guy
[8/31/23, 3:13:44 AM] Mark Finch: He was playing in Ronnie Scott’s !
[8/31/23, 11:30:43 AM] Peter Milne: Looking forward to hearing more stories. Favourite/Scariest teacher? Mr. King was cool; taught me German and French. Mr. Breadon was scary and was very good at hitting kids with the board rubber.🤪
[8/31/23, 11:30:53 AM] Chris: Hello it's taken me a while to get to this but here goes
After Reeds took a year off and then went to Hull to do Law. Got a degree and went to Guildford Law School and started a career as a solicitor. It soon became clear that wasn't the right decision and after a year and half qualified I left. Took a couple of years of knocking on doors, doing temp jobs etc but eventually broke into TV production. And have been doing it ever since. Mostly freelance so  did a couple of years on The Big Breakfast, Big Brother and a few years going to Australia every year for I'm a Celebrity.  Tried my hand at commissioning at Sky, ran Gordon Ramsay's production co for a while (turns out he's a t**t - who knew?!) and now I'm running Mentorn Media. We make Question Time and Traffic Cops amongst other things. 
Personally - and more importantly - I married Sarah Parker (Sparker - for those of you knew her back in the day). We have 2 children. Joe 16 and Betty 15 - have been in Balham Sth London for over 20 years. Loved hearing all your stories and looking forward to catching up.
[8/31/23, 11:31:25 AM] S-P: Totally with you there!
[8/31/23, 11:50:53 AM] Andrew Shiells: I’ve recently been getting revenge for many on this chat by beating up Kevin Harper on the padel court at Oxshott! 🤪
Look forward to catching up with as many as possible next year at reunion day I’ve been going most of the last 10 years to play in the Dylan Paris memorial cricket match and saw Lucius Peart & Johnny price celebrating their 30 year’s anniversary this year. I think they had 10 so would be great to smash that number. Before I post life stuff and spoil the surprises it would be good to see how many hope to get there next June? I’m in for sure great effort Finchy so far 👏🤗
[8/31/23, 12:00:23 PM] James Eason: I remember Sarah well, we were at Moleside together; I’ll see if I have a photo from the school photo.
[8/31/23, 12:09:41 PM] Dave Wilko: Like many of you I’m blown away by the names I’ve seen in this chat and the memories from first Moleside with some and then Reeds.
Thanks to Dave Edwards I got reconnected with Sheila, Andy G, Finchie, Pix ( though not seen him in the flesh yet) through golf.
I too remember Chris breaking his arm in the close, I was standing there at the top of the wall and won’t forget🙈
And remember Sarah and met her again at a funeral a few years back 
I will be there next June 👍
[8/31/23, 12:38:45 PM] Peter Milne: Crazy to think that we are connected after all these years, even going back to Moleside!
[8/31/23, 12:42:26 PM] Mark Finch: Shiella - it was their 40th anniversary ! 😀

BTW, I am defiantly “In” for June 30th and I like Pixies idea of making a weekend of it ! Maybe the Vic the day before, Sat 29th ?! ‎<This message was edited>
[8/31/23, 12:43:59 PM] Andrew Shiells: 🤣failed maths A level obviously
[8/31/23, 12:46:08 PM] Peter Milne: What happened to Dylan? He was next door neighbour way back. I knew the family really well, and I remember that his mum Susie remarried. Phil Slocombe who used to play cricket for Somerset.
[8/31/23, 1:17:45 PM] Nick Haigh: ‎Nick Haigh joined using this group's invite link
[8/31/23, 12:49:09 PM] S-P: Me too-really impressed this is happening!
[8/31/23, 12:59:01 PM] Andrew Shiells: Unfortunately he took his own life very sad. Phil played in a couple of the early matches his son still does and his wife Lynne comes along each year. 😢
[8/31/23, 1:00:45 PM] Peter Milne: I had no idea, Andy. That is so 😔
[8/31/23, 1:18:51 PM] Peter Milne: Great story. You have to post a picture of you and Sarah!
[8/31/23, 1:19:09 PM] Mark Finch: Wey Hey ! Welcome Nick Haigh ! Hell that was difficult ! Technical gremlins !!!
[8/31/23, 1:20:04 PM] Nick Haigh: Thanks for the intro and the help getting onboard !
[8/31/23, 1:21:17 PM] Nick Haigh: And how to whoever is out there :)
[8/31/23, 1:56:28 PM] William Pendered: Hi Nick, Dave and Chris recent joiners, it is great to hear from you all. I will Def hope to be there 👍
[8/31/23, 2:09:26 PM] Nick Carey: I never had Mr Breadon for any lessons but was well aware of his reputation, so when I discovered he was taking the remedial set for 4th/5th yr cricket I was devastated… but he was an absolute gent! Obvs very different from the class room! 
Loved Alan King but my favourite had to be Eric… rugby, biology & CCF, 3 of my favourite things lol - on tour to Amsterdam constantly calling the local currency “gliders”. Nicky Sly my most feared, and I only got him in 6th form! Geoff could be both terrifying and avuncular at the same time! 🤣
[8/31/23, 2:19:41 PM] William Pendered: 👍 Yes that Amsterdam tour was a classic, Eric "bally bally". Recall with Purgos as well? Peggy Wright was also a great early mentor for us in the Close. Then the wrath of Basil as housemaster who insisted I took A level chemistry 🙄
[8/31/23, 3:04:46 PM] Andrew Shiells: Me too which I failed as well 🙄
[8/31/23, 3:09:54 PM] Mark Finch: #snap on the Chemistry fail !
[8/31/23, 3:11:35 PM] Roger Attwell: Don’t worry about failing an A level you should have seen my O level results…….
[8/31/23, 3:15:55 PM] Roger Attwell: After our mocks Tyson kindly wrote in his comments on my end of term report “Roger is set to get the worst O level results in the year”
I duly obliged!
[8/31/23, 3:50:54 PM] Jo Chan: I thought I was the only dude who fail most subjects. That’s why Mr Prince summoned me n Nick Bond to see him together and tell us what we should do after Reeds. So embarrassing. 😭
[8/31/23, 3:56:44 PM] Jon R: I failed geog O level but turned up for Geoff Martins geog A level class. He asked me to stay behind and at the end asked what did I think was doing. I said giving him a challenge
[8/31/23, 4:26:33 PM] Roger Attwell: That’s priceless!!!
[8/31/23, 10:35:34 PM] Malcolm: I'll never forget Basil Green saying to me ,I have tried to encourage you morally, I've tried to encourage you verbally and not I'm going to try some physical encouragement before giving me 6 of the best. Obviously did not work considering exit strategy.🤣
[8/31/23, 10:51:06 PM] Malcolm: That was meant to now not "not" about the physical encouragement
[8/31/23, 10:56:00 PM] Giles Solomon: I remember extremely well my last 6 from Basil. He said, “do you know what you are Solomon”. I said “no sir”. He then produced a really long word, which to this day I can’t remember (likely trauma 😂) and said “do you know what that means?”  I said, “no sir”. He said “it means you’re a liar Solomon, now bend down” Thwack x 6💥 😂😂.
[9/1/23, 12:27:44 AM] Nick Carey: Yup, Mike Pyrgos too - did you notice his son got a handful of caps for Scotland? In your old position Pix
[9/1/23, 12:54:54 AM] Mark Finch: Great memories. I do recollect that Uilliam Littleboy spent a lot of time in the back row of a live sex show with his big black coat on his lap ! 😂
I suspect a few here were in that show (you know who you are). I was flabbergasted 
a) at the guys staying power and 
b) him and his partner finished and then immediately went behind the bar and served the beer stark bollock naked !!! 

Did we actually play rugby on that tour ?! 😂

I can’t find any link to Littleboy. I wonder if trades descriptions made him change his name !
[9/1/23, 12:56:33 AM] Mark Finch: There was also a great picture someone must have of Eric “Bally-Bally” with two young ladies on his lap applying lipstick to his face - very very badly !!! I suspect he hunted the photos down and destroyed them !!!
[9/1/23, 1:21:17 AM] Nick Carey: I have found a possible FB id for Bill and have left a message, no response so far…

[9/1/23, 1:35:37 AM] William Pendered: Yes, it was noted
[9/1/23, 1:35:42 AM] Nick Carey: I remember playing a game under lights (for the first time) and (Andy?Peter?) Reid peeling off the back of a maul and making a barnstorming run… 90 degrees into touch!
[9/1/23, 1:36:58 AM] William Pendered: He's a pirate, agaghhh
[9/1/23, 1:40:19 AM] Mark Finch: David I think (has a brother Mark who was in the first form, the year before I joined in the second form). Also had an older brother a couple of years ahead of us.
[9/1/23, 1:43:04 AM] James Eason: There was Mark Reid, who spent just spent a couple of years in the close he was with me at prep school for a number of years, he went off to Dollar Academy, but his brother, two years younger, David remained at the school, if I remember rightly would’ve been in Bristowe. He set up the jewellers Gordon Marks in Cobham.
[9/1/23, 1:43:21 AM] Nick Carey: My mind probably blocking it out coz I got dropped for him in one game in our last year (my lack of mobility)… but our scrum got mullered so I came straight back for the next game… never forgave him though! 🤣
‎[9/1/23, 1:44:28 AM] James Eason: ‎<attached: 00000291-PHOTO-2023-09-01-01-44-28.jpg>
[9/1/23, 1:45:37 AM] Nick Carey: Thanks James, I think that’s him. Def a year or two below us and in Bristowe, so all stacking up.
[9/1/23, 1:52:12 AM] Mark Finch: Yes I pinged him on that email a few weeks ago Jez, but waiting to hear back - so if anyone has him number and want to check whether he wants to join ?- @447768686201 ?!!!
[9/1/23, 2:04:48 AM] Peter Milne: Now, there is an infamous name from the past!!
[9/1/23, 2:34:22 AM] Barry Cawston: Hi all Barry here and I too think this is an extraordinary thing especially as we seem to be getting to almost the whole year group
[9/1/23, 3:12:45 AM] Tim Clark: ‎Mark Finch added Tim Clark
[9/1/23, 2:47:19 AM] Barry Cawston: A quick potted history of the interim years 
Did an amazing trip round the US with chris brogden in a year off … not quite sure how we survived as most of the way we both h hiked 
Then ended up at Leeds  Uni followed by doing a photography course in oth Andy Glass which shaped both of our futures. 
I spent seven great years in Yorkshire then moved to East London where I lived in a Lithuanian village hall complete with 24hr drinking den downstairs frequented by East London gangsters and vodka drinking east Europeans . It was quite messy 

Then met my ex partner Soraya and moved to Somerset where we had a daughter Lyla ( who is now 17) and did up two ruined buildings but unfortunately it ruined us too. 😁still friends we live in the two buildings 
Mine is the Drugstore which is where I run the Drugstore Gallery from. 

We do art fairs in the Uo and abroad and have had the chance to do lots of crazy trips … following the Yangtze across China sponsored by Nikon and spending a week in a tribal  village in the Amazon . For some reason me and my work has made me quite famous in a small part of Germany.  It’s a funny old world 

I did a book on banksys dismaland and he put 30 of the pictures form it on his website for two years and no I’m afraid I can’t tell you anything about him 

A few years ago I was asked to curate an art exhibition by old reedonians in London so got to see a few folk then and am in contact with Zaid and Tim clark who both are talented creatives 

More to follow but lovely to reconnect
[9/1/23, 2:53:46 AM] John Vocking: I think i have that book 😳
[9/1/23, 2:56:01 AM] James Eason: Hi Jon, while I have you here, about 20 years ago, I spent a day at Henley with your nephew, also called John? With the Cracknells (as in James) and Bev Turner.
[9/1/23, 2:56:28 AM] James Eason: “John” should have read - forgive me.
[9/1/23, 2:57:57 AM] John Vocking: Forgiven🤣 Yep he’s Jon I’m John. Not too many Vockings about let alone Jon/Johns😎
[9/1/23, 3:03:16 AM] John Vocking: I think you can shout “House”
[9/1/23, 3:13:20 AM] Mark Finch: Welcome Tim Clarke (thanks Pascal !!)
[9/1/23, 3:45:42 AM] Peter Milne: So many @447917428535 . You've done great! It would be really interesting to share some old Reeds photos. Apart from the Blathwayt one, I don't seem to have any others.

[9/1/23, 7:42:12 AM] Tom Hardiment: (sorry)... all the Reed's boys were asked to leave. Turns out B-H had walked through a plate glass window and then told the headteacher she was pig ugly. Classic. Hope you can track down B-H.

Thanks again Finchie. Will definitely be there next June. They're gonna need a bigger tent.
[9/1/23, 7:49:50 AM] Nick Carey: “They're gonna need a bigger tent.” 🤣 love it!
Looking very dapper in that pic Tom!
[9/1/23, 7:51:45 AM] Tom Hardiment: Thx Nick. Hired the tux for Johnny's A level graduation!

[9/1/23, 8:09:15 AM] Barry Cawston: Kieran lived with andy g and I in Leeds for a year … it was a sleepless period so daily I would grab a sneaky nap on a park bench after college until one day I was mistaken for a tramp by some American tourists… 

As for kieran he ended up living in a Buddhist community in E London then got into competitive road cycling and did lots of travelling 

Another dynamic path … haven’t seen him for a few years though
[9/1/23, 8:21:58 AM] Tom Hardiment: Thanks Barry.

I met up with Graham Hales back in 2014. Is he in the group?
‎[9/1/23, 8:23:36 AM] Mark Finch: ‎<attached: 00000315-PHOTO-2023-09-01-08-23-36.jpg>
[9/1/23, 8:24:28 AM] Mark Finch: In my defence. The picture is how I imagined him (don’t tell him if we track him down 😂😂😂)
[9/1/23, 8:24:47 AM] Mark Finch: Hilarious 😂😂😂
[9/1/23, 8:24:53 AM] Barry Cawston: A funny kieran story 
He was stopped on the tube without a ticket by a policemen. The sharp eyed policemen asked kieran if his feet reached the end of his shoes … he was wearing winkle pickers … to which kieran replied ‘ does your head teach the top of your helmet ‘… policemen was less than impressed
[9/1/23, 8:47:21 AM] Tom Hardiment: Don't worry Finchie, I'll email him and won't mention the photo! He hasn't changed a bit.
[9/1/23, 8:47:47 AM] Mark Finch: Perfect 😀
[9/1/23, 9:01:55 AM] Nick Haigh: HI everyone and thanks to Finchie for making this possible.  To be honest I have not maintained much contact with people from school since we left save a few. 

So a little about my journey.  I completely failed my A-levels owing to spending far too much time sailing rather than schooling, though somehow, I managed to get into further education at Brighton Poly.  That kept me in contact with Nick Carey and Guy Finned through university days and for a while after.

Having decided that the Engineering degree I got was not what I wanted I got into IT and moved from Brighton to the Farnborough/Camberley area. This is where I met my wife, Zoe, and we are celebrating our 30th anniversary this year.

After school I spent a lot of time with Mark Foulsham (happy birthday today!) and Guy Wood (RIP ☹️).  That was really the basis of my main social circle at that time.

In 1999 we had our first child, Elizabeth (now 23 and in Law School) and then in 2001 I decided to take a work opportunity and move the family to the States, landing on the East Coast in the New York Area.  In 2005 I got into consulting and that took me all over the States and working with all sorts of companies.  It is still what I do today but with much less travel.  In 2008 we had a second child, Isabelle, who is now 15, failing High School, and who is likely to be Elizabeths first client! 

Through my consulting days I was spending way too much time on the West Coast and so about 10 years ago we moved to the San Francisco Bay Area which is where I am now.  Without a doubt the best part of the world I have lived in so far.

My memories of Reeds are mixed, some good mainly in the really stupid shit we got up to and some bad, mainly the education.  I have often wondered what it would be like to be more connected to people from those days so maybe this is a chance.

I don’t have much opportunity to get back to the UK but am looking to see if I can make this reunion work in some way.
[9/1/23, 9:07:47 AM] James Eason: Hi Nick, I must say I echo your comments about mixed feelings about Reed’s; I think there were some great times, but I think in some respects there were times when we were a bit let down by the teaching. It seems a bit weird that quite a few boys could fall through holes in an educational net; that said, I think the school prepared us for life, and even though perhaps many of us on this in this group didn’t really succeed academically, we were all able to make a pretty good fist of it all.
[9/1/23, 9:09:29 AM] James Eason: One particular memory of course was using big French bangers (pascal?) to create a crater in the all weather pitch and to get caught by Peggy as he was whistling his way down from shack.
[9/1/23, 9:11:56 AM] Nick Haigh: OMG, I remember that!  Also supplies of noodles from Joe Chan and some crazy game in the common room involving golf balls, hockey sticks, and near-death experiences.
[9/1/23, 9:15:38 AM] Nick Carey: Murder ball in the mullens 4yr common room! How did we not kill anybody?
[9/1/23, 9:16:56 AM] Roger Attwell: Didn’t Joe Chan also bring us Chinese fire crackers?
[9/1/23, 9:17:14 AM] James Eason: Plenty of damage chits for the windows.
[9/1/23, 9:20:19 AM] James Eason: I don’t remember, but try  bringing those through in your carry-on luggage these days.
[9/1/23, 9:20:22 AM] Jo Chan: Let’s not talk about all the illegal import. 😂 But we (pascal) had a blast 💥 No pun intended.
[9/1/23, 9:20:32 AM] John Vocking: I also remember NC being the porn king 😳. The youth of today will never understand the struggle to get decent open. H&E was often the only thing on offer. Great to hear from TNFH!  How’s your brother Ben?  Good Mullens representation here. No James Myers yet. Remember staying in a tent in his Garden in Bosham whilst doing Duke of Edinburgh trails. AD had an encounter with some bikers too.

It all fell apart when the prefects found out - never got in any trouble, they just kept raiding my stock!
[9/1/23, 9:25:15 AM] Guy Finney: Just getting ready for corporate life where this is typical Boardroom from my experience just not as honest!
[9/1/23, 9:28:37 AM] Jo Chan: You were trained well from the early age :)
[9/1/23, 9:29:29 AM] Jo Chan: Haydar woz enjoying the show.
[9/1/23, 9:32:10 AM] Guy Finney: Yes always look innocent 😇
[9/1/23, 9:50:36 AM] Haydar Shawkat: I was but that soon changed…😀
[9/1/23, 9:56:13 AM] Tom Hardiment: Ben's well thanks John. Great to hear from you! Hope to see you nxt June
[9/1/23, 10:05:44 AM] Jon R: Believe I was on that walk too with Mark Justesen aswell I think
[9/1/23, 10:13:20 AM] Mark Finch: Anyone remember the name of the lad getting strangled ? I don’t think he’s on my list !!!
[9/1/23, 10:15:10 AM] Jo Chan: Hey Mark. U can’t remember my strangled 👀 look?
[9/1/23, 10:18:47 AM] Peter Milne: Great to hear from you, Nick, and it sounds like a really interesting journey you have been on. Definitely get the mixed feelings thing about Reeds. I did keep in touch briefly with a few people after I left after 5th form, including Guy Wood, rest his soul. It was weird because, as I didn't go through 6th form, I didn't really feel like an OR, but it is great to be back in touch after so long. In my consultancy role, I work a lot with UK independent schools, and they have certainly changed. Good in ways, but they can't get away with the stuff we did and I guess that was why we remember so well the fun of firecrackers, crazy kitchen staff, slightly dodgy teachers, gozzing, playing rugby in heavy snow, Ma Holt's knickers. I remember selling raw leeks that I grew to starving boarders in the Close! Being caught coming out of the broom cupboard having found the passage down the WW2 air raid shelter. After 40 years, there are some great stories coming from everyone, and looking forward to catching up in June.
[9/1/23, 10:23:37 AM] Mark Finch: Haha - ooops - just seen it was you. There was another bristowe boy in second form - just there for a year. Dark hair. For the life of me can’t remember his name. When I get home I’ll share a photo !
[9/1/23, 10:25:52 AM] Jo Chan: You r not thinking Ivan Lo? He joined Reeds after The Close year.
‎[9/1/23, 10:49:23 AM] Peter Potts: ‎<attached: 00000346-PHOTO-2023-09-01-10-49-23.jpg>
[9/1/23, 10:58:33 AM] David Edwards: Finchie…is Bob Nicholas, Stan (Dave) Strange and Mike Souness on your list. I think Pix and AG have Bob’s contact details.
[9/1/23, 11:27:30 AM] Malcolm: A Bob and Stan, both with me in the house, when we were caught drinking and smoking that lead to my expulsion, If I remember Mike he was massively into war games.
[9/1/23, 11:42:57 AM] Mark Finch: I reckon you mean “Bertie” Nichols and Mike Souber ?!
[9/1/23, 11:43:15 AM] Mark Finch: And yes - definately trying to track them down !
[9/1/23, 11:48:16 AM] Jo Chan: William Beaves. Ian do___?
[9/1/23, 1:10:44 PM] Tim Clark: A big hello…gents…. This is exciting 🤗hope everyone is well
[9/1/23, 1:20:34 PM] Tim Clark: In a nut shell - went to art college-married-London -Motion graphics designer BBC/ Channel 4- no kids. I think I left in 83.
[9/1/23, 1:43:58 PM] Mark Finch: Shiellsy will love this !
[9/1/23, 1:45:02 PM] Andrew Shiells: 🤣love a nut shell
[9/1/23, 1:45:26 PM] Andrew Shiells: The memory on my phone is full!
[9/1/23, 1:48:14 PM] Andrew Shiells: 🤷‍♂️
[9/1/23, 1:55:50 PM] James Eason: Can you recreate us as characters? Moving around school? Looking up Ma Holt’s skirt?
[9/1/23, 1:58:32 PM] Malcolm: Was Phil Hardy in our year? Mullins?
[9/1/23, 1:58:38 PM] Peter Potts: Well, we could all login and create our own characters. And then fire arrows at each other.
[9/1/23, 2:03:58 PM] James Eason: Blathwayt
[9/1/23, 2:04:59 PM] Malcolm: Another to add to the list for @447917428535 to track down
[9/1/23, 2:11:12 PM] Peter Milne: It would be great to track down Phil Hardy. Good mate back in the day.
[9/1/23, 2:32:58 PM] Tim Clark: THERE WILL BE OTHER NUT SHELLS AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT COLOURS ( PS I'M RENDERING SO CAP LOCKS ARE ON)
[9/1/23, 2:33:41 PM] Mike Nunan: Also James Grist, I have a number for him that I've been meaning and failing to use for the longest time
[9/1/23, 2:33:59 PM] Mike Nunan: Be great to find Mark Foulsham too
[9/1/23, 2:34:23 PM] Mike Nunan: I'm definitely up for the in person meet next year, weekend event sounds great
[9/1/23, 2:35:48 PM] Mike Nunan: @16095169175 v good to see you here, I have vivid memories of us mucking about in Basil's double chem talking about BMW M-cars and other nonsense
[9/1/23, 2:38:24 PM] Nick Haigh: @447973187547 - I remember well.  BTW, I have access to Mark - I will see if I can get him looped in.
[9/1/23, 2:39:54 PM] Mark Finch: Yes. Blathwayte I think
[9/1/23, 2:40:01 PM] Mike Nunan: That'd be brilliant
[9/1/23, 2:40:12 PM] Mike Nunan: Definitely
[9/1/23, 2:41:13 PM] Mike Nunan: I think actor Tom Hardy must be related to him, he went to Reed's I believe and there's a resemblance - cousins perhaps?
[9/1/23, 2:44:25 PM] Mike Nunan: There was an advert in one of the colour supplements we were poring over, for the 635 CSi and original M5, it had the lines over each of them, "When you're late for the airport ... When you're *really* late for the airport" 🤣 Have previously scoured the web for an image of it but no luck sadly!
[9/1/23, 2:46:20 PM] Andrew Shiells: Thought you all pored over Jerry chipchases porn mags!
[9/1/23, 2:46:38 PM] Nick Haigh: I do remember being a big fan of BMWs but the odd thing is I never ended up owning one. Still love my cars though :)
[9/1/23, 2:54:52 PM] Mike Nunan: William Littleboy was the most enthusiastic collector of them I thought!
[9/1/23, 2:59:06 PM] Mike Nunan: Having fun in cars had been a big part of my life that's for sure, probably why I never have much money in the bank!
[9/1/23, 3:08:25 PM] Andrew Shiells: That’s why he’s still in disguise trawling for fish!
[9/1/23, 3:37:12 PM] Mike Nunan: Full nerd power, do it 💪🏽
[9/2/23, 12:19:17 AM] Mark Finch: Morning All ! For all those that are working - Happy Weekend. For all those retired - it’s the weekend 😂

If you can spare a moment this weekend - let me know if you have any connection to any of these ORs in our year that I’m trying to track down… I have no connection at all …

[9/2/23, 12:23:44 AM] James Eason: I recall it was Neil Harkness Brown?, and definitely ‘Stuart’ Lamont - a good chum for a year or so after school and then he went a bit weird on me and disappeared to the US - I’ll have a go at tracking him down again.
[9/2/23, 12:28:29 AM] Mark Finch: Thanks for filling in the gaps Jez.
[9/2/23, 12:30:15 AM] James Eason: And that’s the first time I have been called Jez in 40 years. Roger A chose it for me… 🤣
[9/2/23, 12:34:12 AM] Mark Finch: And in return did you choose “Bumhead” for Roger ? 😂😂😂
[9/2/23, 12:39:19 AM] James Eason: ‎This message was deleted.
[9/2/23, 12:39:41 AM] James Eason: Sadly, don’t think I can claim that little win.

[9/2/23, 12:44:47 AM] David Edwards: How about Robert Lodge? He is one of 4 brothers that run Lodge Brothers Funeral Directors (which I think been in family for several generations!)…does anyone have his contact #, otherwise I can try via his office.
[9/2/23, 12:48:17 AM] David Edwards: It was James Myers
[9/2/23, 12:48:39 AM] James Eason: Great point, I should be able to find him quite easily, as he is running the funeral directors who dealt with my mother‘s cremation earlier this year (I mentioned it to them and they said he’s still very much active in the business), I’ll drop them a line.
[9/2/23, 12:50:23 AM] Mark Finch: Nice !
[9/2/23, 12:53:36 AM] Peter Milne: I kept in touch with Jamie Moreton for a while. He was a good friend and we used to play golf a lot. He used to live in Claygate. I will try to track him down. Also, James Grist. I will see what I can do there.
[9/2/23, 12:58:55 AM] Mark Finch: Also just a heads up - Pete Griffin doesn’t do WhatsApp ! That’s a story for over a beer as I vaguely recollect it involved a female - either current or ex-wife 😂

However a fair few of us are in touch with him. He lives near Goodwood and seems to spend a lot of time playing golf there !!

I’m keeping him updated on this little activity. 

We might even get to see him next year - but we would all have to pretend it’s a golf day and our handicaps are very good 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[9/2/23, 1:17:28 AM] Chris: I might be able to get to Phil Hardy - I'm good friends with Rachel Tatton Brown (younger sister of Claire - who's in Australia) and am pretty sure they  still in touch with him
[9/2/23, 1:34:03 AM] Giles Solomon: Ok Gents. Here’s my life recap. Apologies for length but hey, I’m old! 

Left Reeds after O’ Levels for Kingston sixth form college (along with Marc Yates, Bert Nichols and Neville Stevens) having convinced my Dad that I wanted to study computer science and couldn’t do it at Reeds. Gave up computer science after 1 year (very angry Dad!) and might as well have given up my other 2 A Level choices too, as being left to my own devices to attend lectures and study didn’t seem to work too well (too many pubs in Kingston 🤣). Messed around for a few years working in pubs and call centres before heading off to Australia on a working holiday in 1992. Visa eventually ran out and not wanting to go back to England, got a job as a holiday rep for Thomson holidays and spent the next 3 summers in Tenerife looking after British tourists and leading pub crawls of up to 500 drunk Brits through the streets of Playa de Las Americas! Met Cosmos rep, Tracy, in Tenerife (from Crewe not Essex – not sure which is worse) and we’ve now been together for 32 years now and have a daughter, Natasha, aged 15. Then on to Crete, Malta followed by 3 years in Gran Canaria selling timeshare of all things (amazing what a private education can do for you) resulting in the start of my sales career. Then on to Canada, Belgium, Budapest and back to Canada. Became a Canadian Citizen, then found a work sponsorship opportunity, which took me back to Australia in 2004. 14 years in Sydney and past 5 years living on the Sunshine Coast of Australia. Bloody wonderful place to live and very happy here. Once I turned 50, decided it was time to try and reverse the many years of smoking and boozing and am probably fitter now than I ever have been. I ocean swim, play golf, tennis, run and go to the gym. Also hiked to Everest Base camp in May, which was pretty amazing. Changed my career in 2007 and found my way into the recruitment sector and am now working for a small tech business involved in corporate psychometric assessment. Keen on most sports, still a Chelsea fan and always England, especially when against Australia 😁. I stay in touch with Marc Yates (he lives in Taunton) although try not to advertise that too loudly!
 
Highlights of my Reeds education include Mr Proctor firing a well-aimed piece of chalk at my forehead and calling me a social leper 😂, being caught going through the school front door, resulting in my first experience of the cane and Mr Green making it very clear that life would be easier for me if I didn’t give up playing the oboe (I’m sure there was a similar type scene in the Shawshank Redemption!). Fond memories also, of going to Claygate (Hare & Hounds, I think) with Jeremy Chipchase for my first pint in a pub, aged 14, hanging round at Dave Edwards place smoking and listening to Meatloaf and Rush. Also recall a great punch up with Wolfie Smith in the Bristowe common room (honourable draw) with Marc Yates, in the background, shouting ”hit him Wolfie, hit him!” How I went on to be Yates’s best man at his wedding is beyond me!
 
This chat group/reunion is evoking so many memories – bloody good to be in touch with you all. Well done Finchie. Very sadly, won’t be able to make the reunion (unless there’s scope for a change of date!). Cheers, Giles.
[9/2/23, 1:38:25 AM] Mark Finch: We’ll do another one when you come over ;-)
[9/2/23, 1:55:39 AM] Giles Solomon: Deal! 👍.
[9/2/23, 2:15:18 AM] David Edwards: Great stories!
[9/2/23, 2:22:26 AM] Peter Milne: What a great story! Sunshine Coast sounds fantastic. Good call on the 50 + change of lifestyle. I think I have ended up drinking more since turning 50! Have to work on that😜. By the way, you're not old, as they would make us all old!
[9/2/23, 2:24:10 AM] Malcolm: One common theme here, we all appear to have great memories of school but apart from a few our academic achievements earned from our education do not appear to have been a great return on our parents investment
[9/2/23, 2:35:24 AM] Tim Clark: One main difference from Reeds to my prep school was the family structure. Reeds was an orphanage  or something  similar when it was set up. Those values seemed to carry on to our time there. My mum was a single parent at that stage and most of my friends at Reeds were in the same situation. That helped my mum too, meeting like minded mums . At the prep school it was mainly 2 parent, multiple children families. I preferred the Reeds vibe.
[9/2/23, 2:40:02 AM] Jon R: I found the opposite but that may have been down to who was heading the house. My memories are pretty sketchy of my time at Reeds but I did find it restrictive and couldn’t get away quickly enough
[9/2/23, 2:40:41 AM] Barry Cawston: You are right Tim … I had a chance to go to charter house but even at 13 the vibe felt monied and elitist. 

I remember clearly a day in the library when one by one people opened up about their family stories… changed my understanding of them and the world instantly 

As for the education I retook history at a Cramer in London and arrived and put our Reeds class text book on the table and the young teacher walked over looked at it and picked it up and put it in the bin saying you would be get a D at O level if you studied from that ..😁
[9/2/23, 2:42:12 AM] James Eason: So true; something I alluded to earlier - but we survived.
[9/2/23, 2:52:50 AM] Malcolm: I gave made a lif long friend through the School, I still see Justyn Herbert, the year below us and I still have some contact with Tim Robb, also the year below
[9/2/23, 2:56:23 AM] Nick Carey: I must be a bit of a weirdo (shut up at the back there! No need to agree so vehemently! 😁) but I have (almost) entirely fond memories of school… It might have helped that I was a day boy, so “got away” every night, although the older I got, the more time I spent at school, often not going home til 9.00 or 10.00 at night (home was fine but cloying & a bit isolating)… probably not a top notch education but then I never really put any pressure on it (always been a bit of a coaster). I would echo the several comments that it was the shenanigans we got up to and learning to beat the system (almost the unwritten subject on the curriculum) that served us best.
[9/2/23, 3:00:29 AM] Peter Milne: Being a day boy was certainly a different experience, especially as the school for me was a 5 minute walk away! I loved all the sport, and that remains my best memory as far as the teaching was concerned.
[9/2/23, 3:01:40 AM] Mark Finch: Agreed Malc. No regrets, but Basil “forcing” all those Bristowe to do Chemistry A level so at least he had a class to teach ! 😂 Keith Youde taking up maths A level for the first time when he was clueless ! However “mad” Frank Anstis was a brilliant Physics teacher - very engaging and as a result I knocked it out the park with a D 😂😂😂
[9/2/23, 3:06:34 AM] Malcolm: Sunday afternoon detentions, sitting for 3 hours doing absolutely nothing,  whites A4 20 words per line both sides on the sex life of a ping pong ball, and gatings. The cane was a far better choice
[9/2/23, 3:07:49 AM] Barry Cawston: And each letter in a different colour 😁
[9/2/23, 3:08:17 AM] Malcolm: Never got that one
[9/2/23, 3:14:46 AM] Malcolm: I was also lucky with Gatings, Julian Smith AKA Hunch an Ex prefect use to live up the road and he would sign my whole card and most prefects would accept it😁
[9/2/23, 3:14:59 AM] Jon R: I remember one early punishment I got was to score all day for one of the cricket teams. Radio on listening to Borg McEnroe final nicking the orange juice. Thought I could get used to this. If they wanted me to learn a lesson in discipline that wasn’t it 😂
[9/2/23, 3:18:26 AM] Tim Clark: That was a classic Ian Griffin task.
[9/2/23, 4:01:28 AM] Mike Nunan: Afraid this was me too really, although still great to reconnect with everyone here. Probably a big part of it was the fact my mum was terminally ill from when I joined in 3rd form then passed on during term time in November 82. Getting the news from Blathwayt housemaster Michael (???? dammit) is a lifetime memory I could do without, although he was very sensitive about it indeed. But for one reason or other I never felt like I fitted the place and team sports always were my nemesis
[9/2/23, 4:03:09 AM] Jo Chan: My memory is fading. Is the current headmaster once upon a time “The close” house master? Mr. Hoskin
[9/2/23, 4:03:40 AM] James Eason: No different chap.
[9/2/23, 4:05:06 AM] James Eason: He’s Mark Hoskins; our chap was Graham/Graeme Hoskins.
[9/2/23, 4:09:20 AM] Mark Finch: Mike Hewitt ! I liked him. Particularly as when he caught me snogging ;-) the headmasters daughter on the high jump mat / shed one night - he never spilled the beans.  I felt a nice little wet patch and thought the magic happening. Sadly that wet patch ended up being Hewitt’s dogs nose 😂 Elaine / “Lainey” ended up marrying a proper chap - army officer I think !
[9/2/23, 4:12:27 AM] Mike Nunan: Hewitt yes, thanks for the memory jog. He was indeed a very good guy and seemed to like me better than Eric did, who just didn't seem to take to the cut of my jib
[9/2/23, 4:13:16 AM] Mike Nunan: He also seemed to find it endlessly funny to greet me by saying "morning Nunan - morning Nunan night!"
[9/2/23, 4:16:51 AM] Mark Finch: 😂😂😂
[9/2/23, 4:17:57 AM] James Eason: In a slightly bizarre or perverted way, I am slightly reassured by the the overall dissatisfaction in the educational levels for our year; perhaps it was a trough that they were in at the time as I recall my brother’s year, two years above, seemed to have suffered a similar fate (ALL) bright folk.  Maybe time to seek reparations….s’what folks do these days, eh.  As Malcolm said, not what we as adults would consider a reasonable ROI. My biggest peave came when Geoff Martin dropped me from the 1st Eleven or something because I chose to play for Surrey against Sussex that particular Saturday. It’s also one of the reasons I have sent my daughter to Millfield; to avoid that kind of parochial attitude. I saw Geoff at an ORs reunion about 8 years ago, still thought he was a twat. Rant over, soz.
‎[9/2/23, 4:20:46 AM] James Eason: ‎<attached: 00000429-PHOTO-2023-09-02-04-20-46.jpg>
[9/2/23, 4:29:11 AM] Malcolm: Failure to Educate! I've dealt with a few of those liability claims lodged against schools🤣
[9/2/23, 4:30:28 AM] Barry Cawston: I can see it 
A class class action
[9/2/23, 4:31:50 AM] Barry Cawston: Or is it a 
A Class, class class-action
[9/2/23, 4:35:17 AM] Barry Cawston: I guess if I’d had a good education I’d know 😁
[9/2/23, 4:35:25 AM] Malcolm: I remember after I was expelled my parents appointed a solicitor. The expulsions was withdrawn from my record and I was told I could return but I never did.
[9/2/23, 4:35:39 AM] Tom Hardiment: My brother, Ben, was 3 years above us and went from As  and Bs at O level to one single E at A level. He wasn't lazy or rebelling.  An A for O level maths then E at A level makes no sense. He blamed Ma Holt. 

He always joked that the education at Reed's was so bad it didn't give you good enough results to get a good enough job to be able to send your kids there.
[9/2/23, 4:38:07 AM] Jo Chan: Pixie-Did u recall one time when we were in Form3, after dinner, it was our turn cleaning the dining room, we got so hungry like mouses have not eaten for ages. We discovered the fridge when they kept all the icecream. Boy I never consume so much in 5 minutes. Who else was there?
[9/2/23, 4:39:11 AM] James Eason: I say that the motto Fide was rather apt as one was very much going to need faith when setting out on the road after leaving.
[9/2/23, 4:49:01 AM] Tom Hardiment: Not really complaining as I was on a bursary so my mum only paid £200 a term but I went from A for O level biology to a fail (O grade) for A level. Least I didn't go backwards. Harrison fessed up just before the exam and apologised that he had only covered 2 thirds of the sylabus. Remember that Pix & Rob? Even best in class Rob only got a D. He taught himself the S level and got an A! Open and shut case.
[9/2/23, 4:53:03 AM] Giles Solomon: I have fond memories of getting chased off the hockey field by Mr Harrison because I told him to f-off when he pulled me up for what I thought was an extremely poor umpiring decision 🤔🤣.
[9/2/23, 4:55:29 AM] Jo Chan: Best education ROI - Speak your mind
[9/2/23, 5:09:42 AM] David Edwards: Haha…you must of been at school a lot as I thought you were a border 😂
[9/2/23, 5:10:55 AM] Peter Milne: All this is making me feel a lot better about leaving after 5th form, although I still think that I missec out on the sport teams I think I would have made! I ended up with 3 Es in the one year Guildford Tech course I did. It looks like 2 years at Reeds wouldn't have faired much better🤣
[9/2/23, 5:15:21 AM] Barry Cawston: Somehow I managed a B in English at Alevel 
Apparently Mr steadman said to the class the following year … ‘buck your ideas up I mean if cawston can get a B the. Anyone can.’
[9/2/23, 5:55:45 AM] Jon R: He was my housemaster. Couldn’t agree more. Scraped 2 A levels and he said I wouldn’t amount to much. Bumped into him 4yrs later he asked me what was I doing I took great pleasure in telling him I had just graduated with a 2:1 honours degree👹
[9/2/23, 6:07:38 AM] John Vocking: I can relate to that. When i started A levels at Farnham 6th form i was expecting an easy time having come from Reeds. It was a massive shock how far i was behind in Maths and Physics. I gave up Physics after two terms got an maths O level pass at Levels but did get Economics C. My year group there mostly got As and Bs. Of course it could have been that i was a thick, but that wouldn’t say much for the rest of my Reeds A stream class colleagues 🤣🤣

 Decided further education (academic anyway 😉) was not for me and went to work instead. Can’t say i regretted it.
[9/2/23, 7:47:42 AM] ~ Mark: ‎Mark Finch added ~ Mark
[9/2/23, 6:17:43 AM] Nick Carey: OMFG! I never knew that! (The Harrison/biology cockup bit) - the one A level I thought I’d do ok in was biology and I got an ‘O’… (and managed E’s in physics & chemistry) - I always put it down to my laziness but still I never understood the biology result… 🤯
[9/2/23, 7:29:41 AM] Jon R: Years of angst laid to rest 😀
[9/2/23, 8:17:21 AM] Mark Finch: Welcome Mark Foulsham ! Or “Funcky Doobry” as I used to say ! The Finchie, Nick Cary Nick Haigh pincer movement worked (thanks gents) !
[9/2/23, 8:19:52 AM] Mike Nunan: Awesome, brilliant to see you here too Mark
[9/2/23, 8:25:07 AM] Tom Hardiment: Just to put your mind further to rest, Nick, Eric Hearl just sat leaning back in his chair reading from Titty Parke's (Mu, 81) A level notes... I clocked them when he left them on his desk after a lesson once. He ran back in and grabbed them, looking sheepish.
[9/2/23, 8:26:29 AM] Nick Carey: Hahahaha! No bloody wonder then!
[9/2/23, 8:28:03 AM] ~ Mark: Thanks Finchie… yes that was one of many! 😂
[9/2/23, 8:28:31 AM] Nick Carey: Truth be told, after 40 years, I think I have to accept my initial assessment was probably right… I was just a right lazy git! 🤣
[9/2/23, 10:09:57 AM] Peter Potts: I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Reed's School. I had a great rapport with the teachers and had a genuine interest in sports, although I had to bid farewell to rugby due to a string of injuries. Looking back, I realize how fortunate we were because California's private schools have relatively modest sports facilities. This led me to transfer my daughter to a public high school, which have impressive setups, although she still showed no interest in sports, which was a bit disappointing.

I scraped admission into Reed's School because of my exceptional math skills only. During that time, my father faced a life-threatening brain tumor with only a 25% chance of survival. We chose Reed's because they promised to keep me enrolled even if the worst happened. Fortunately, my father survived, albeit with some disabilities, and he is now 89 years old.

Over the years, I steadily climbed the academic ranks, eventually becoming a favorite among the teachers during my A-levels. Such was their trust in me that even when I consumed a third of a bottle of whiskey and had an unfortunate encounter with Hewitt's feet, I escaped any punishment. I think they considered the horrendous hangover the following day punishment enough.

I cherish memories of fireworks being launched from our dormitory windows and the time someone mischievously set one off inside the dormitory, causing it to zip around without causing any harm or starting a fire.

My performance at A-levels was outstanding, earning me a place at Cambridge to study Mathematics. However, there was a condition attached – I had to pass an O-level in a foreign language. As a result, I extended my stay at Reed's for an additional year to study Latin; there was no way I was revisiting French.

During that extra year, I received a somewhat regal treatment, complete with my own room in Blathwayt. I even rigged up a sound system that would automatically turn off when the door opened. Poor Hewitt had a run-in with it when he attempted to reprimand me for playing music too loudly.

Upon arriving at Cambridge, I quickly realized I was lagging behind in Mathematics compared to my peers. While everyone else had studied Further Mathematics at A-level, Reed's had never offered that option. In my very first lecture at Cambridge, the professor urged us to forget everything we had learned in school because the real mathematical journey was commencing.

My time at Cambridge was a true eye-opener, offering a challenging and transformative experience. On the sports front, the hockey skills I acquired at Reed's proved incredibly valuable. I earned a spot in the St John's College first team for three years and even had the opportunity to play in the University 3rd team on one occasion.
[9/2/23, 10:47:09 AM] Nick Carey: Memories filtering back in… on the subject of poor maths teaching, I (and a few others) had to do additional maths tuition coz I was doing physics A level - had lessons with Sly and simply could not grasp quadratic equations. Fast forward a year and I had to do the equivalent module at Brighton poly and nailed it. Couldn’t work out why it was so hard just a year previously… 🤷‍♂️

[9/2/23, 12:36:44 PM] Nick Carey: Half of that’s 7s cup was ours! 😉

[9/2/23, 1:42:10 PM] Tim Clark: Don’t mention 7’s. Last game of the year, I was a sub.. in half time I come on and get my teeth kicked in!! Never touched a rugby ball again
[9/2/23, 1:47:54 PM] Nick Carey: We were winning the final game against bristowe (I was skipper) and I jumped out of the line to try to nail Finchie… who obviously just skipped around me leaving me clutching thin air, my only contact being his studs in my face as he disappeared off to try line… leaving us the only sharing the 7s cup and me with a stud mark on my face to remind me for the next couple of weeks that it was all my fault - that’s true devastation Tim!!! 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[9/2/23, 2:09:43 PM] Jon R: I played house rugby twice (shows how thin we were at the time!) first time I played hooker and I was still getting up from a ruck or maul only to find Zaid Twaima bombing straight at me. He trampled all over my face but lost the ball. Shaun gough watching on the lines said good tackle Jonny!! Second time I came on as sub in a sevens game don cameron did his shoulder in and last minute I found myself in the line ball in hand all I had to do was pass it to the outside for an easy run in. Yep forward pass. Didn’t pick me again…
[9/2/23, 3:19:46 PM] Giles Solomon: Seem to remember you were a decent football player though Jon?
[9/2/23, 4:48:48 PM] David Edwards: Does anyone remember the Hymn Book Fight in Chapel? 🫣
[9/2/23, 5:01:33 PM] William Pendered: I will add Kieran
[9/2/23, 5:01:33 PM] William Pendered: Will get Rob Nichols details as well, he's always in contact with my brother Ollie
[9/2/23, 5:01:34 PM] William Pendered: We need to add Claire too if anyone has her details??
[9/2/23, 5:01:35 PM] William Pendered: Yes Tom, I remember our "biology" education. Likely cause on the hot summer days with back door open, we ofter got Kieran BH to hide under the desk and tell P***y Harry, that Kieran had run out the back of classroom. Soon as he went out to find him we locked the back firedoor. We didn't really help ourselves. For me I loved Reeds and had no regrets and lots good mates. Sport and trips to the Vic for 50p happy hour beers, Mike the landlord
[9/2/23, 5:01:35 PM] William Pendered: Kieran and Neville details sent to Mark. Rob N to follow 👍
[9/2/23, 5:01:35 PM] William Pendered: Great stories all and memories flooding back. Just caught up on 160 odd messages, so sorry for sudden barage of responses. So many good friends way back, can't wait to see you all
[9/2/23, 5:01:36 PM] William Pendered: Haydar, recall my sister Jane bumped into you a few years back, am I correct?
[9/3/23, 12:11:54 AM] Mark Finch: Pixie - rules is rules. I know you probably fantasised  about her, and wanted her in our year group but she wasn’t ;-)
[9/3/23, 12:22:27 AM] Mark Finch: I think that was probably the UK record for the number of people that took a whacking ! It was from that PE teacher - I forget his name - Simon Spencer ? (Maybe)
Didn’t he get about 20 of us in a circle down at the close and whack us with his trainer. I have to admit, after that moment, I always felt I really should do discus ! 
For those not there. Picture the scenario. As you may recall, Chapel normally started at 8.40 spot on and a quick prayer ahead of finishing and then starting the day at 9. The “closits” were way down the front (so we were last out). 8.45 and still no teachers had arrived (they were probably chatting up that really fit French teacher). 
One of our year got very bored, and I’d hazard a guess it was any of Sprawson, Pendered, or Edwards. Thought it would be a good idea to lob a hymn book down the back at the 6th form.  Within nano seconds there were 200 hymn books in the air flying across the whole chapel in ALL directions - just at the moment the teachers decided to pop in for a prayer. That image is still embedded in my brain. Best chapel service we ever had 😂
[9/3/23, 12:24:24 AM] Dave Wilko: I remember that and have told that story many times… all hell broke loose😂
[9/3/23, 12:30:25 AM] David Edwards: Great recall…apart from the fact I seem to remember we were 1st year Closets and I have a feeling it was the 2 years that started it? Lucias Piat. Simon Edwards, Dick Bell, Russ Maddock and many other dark forces come to mind! 😂
[9/3/23, 12:31:27 AM] Andy Glass: Hello everyone... brilliant reading through all this - how did we ever survive! 😬 Well done Finchy for getting this together! Some great memories, the sheer terror of being called up to MS3 and being hung up by your jacket on the back of the door, that enormous turd left in the Capel toilets, running the St Andrews gauntlet going to Percys for 10 Rothmans and a packet of polos, getting the train to Claygate for a pint at 14, never looking Animal Taylor in the eye just in case... and winning more rugby matches than we should have... great days.
[9/3/23, 12:41:31 AM] Mark Finch: Ah ha! I only joined in the 2nd form, so must have been then ;-)
[9/3/23, 12:42:53 AM] Mark Finch: And using the “distraction” technique - so are you sure it wasn’t you who started it ? 😂
[9/3/23, 12:43:16 AM] Dave Wilko: You were there😂😂
[9/3/23, 12:43:46 AM] Mark Finch: Sssshhhh !
[9/3/23, 12:49:12 AM] David Edwards: The turd in Capel Toilets!…that reminds me, is Alexander Coombe on the list?
[9/3/23, 12:51:38 AM] David Edwards: Because for whatever reason, somehow, AC seemed to be accused of doing the deed, along with several others I hasten to add!
[9/3/23, 12:51:59 AM] Barry Cawston: There was also the day the whole school got a detention after a Sunday Service when ???? Did a bible reading from the pulpit from memory lost his train of thought several times and tried to repeatedly find his place from the passage in the bible. 

Giggles turned to out right pandemonium when he eventually gave up 2/3 the way through said OH fuck??? And shut the bible 

Anyone remember who the lad was
[9/3/23, 12:53:56 AM] Barry Cawston: I mean the only thing I’m pretty sure of is that it wasn’t me 😁
[9/3/23, 12:54:03 AM] ~ Mark: I’m in regular contact with Phill Hardy - he’s holidaying in Canada currently but will send your number Finchie to see if he’s good to join.
[9/3/23, 12:54:26 AM] William Pendered: Challis I believe Dave
[9/3/23, 12:56:26 AM] John Vocking: Who remembers Confirmation classes. You got tea and biscuits and after a lot of very boring sessions, a sip of wine every Sunday, if you got up early enough of course 😳
[9/3/23, 12:57:54 AM] John Vocking: Also Reed’s was the only school that had a rule of only the Captain plus two best players going for the post match teas. For some reason i always preferred away games. 😎
[9/3/23, 12:58:14 AM] Andy Glass: I remember Challis used to hang out the used tea bags to reuse… false memory? Who can forget the school photo when everyone put 10p pieces in the eyes…. Prince blew a gasket
[9/3/23, 1:03:01 AM] John Vocking: Talking of the Capel turd. 
I remember waiting in line for dinner and seeing a bog wog take a knife from the cutlery tray and march towards a toilet stall. Chopping noises were heard followed by some angry flushing. 
The bog wog duly returned to the dining room, wiping the knife under the arm of his coat before returning said knife back into the cutlery tray🤮
[9/3/23, 1:03:56 AM] Peter Milne: I think I was one of the few who didn't get confirmed and got the wrath of Challis as a result. Never got good marks in RE again and never got the invite to his 'spiritual bonding' trips to the Isle of Skye!
[9/3/23, 1:06:05 AM] John Vocking: All i remember about RE was furiously writing pages of Scripture as Challis read them out at breakneck speed. Don’t remember a single thing from those lessons. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/3/23, 1:08:20 AM] Barry Cawston: Does the mass detention ring any bells … I’ve told that story several times and hope ‘to God’ that it wasn’t a dream
[9/3/23, 1:11:32 AM] Mark Finch: Yes ! I certainly remember the giggling 😂😂😂
[9/3/23, 1:12:29 AM] Barry Cawston: Got a feeling the lad was from Mullins or Blathwait
[9/3/23, 1:31:29 AM] Nick Carey: One of the main terrors of a trip to MS3 being your brother! Although he was far from the most sadistic, he was nonetheless terrifying 🤣
[9/3/23, 1:31:58 AM] Barry Cawston: I concur 😁
[9/3/23, 1:32:41 AM] John Vocking: The very last resort if you needed a gating signature
[9/3/23, 1:40:30 AM] Jon R: MS3 😟. I still shiver when I hear the name Turnbull
[9/3/23, 1:43:13 AM] Jon R: Wow what a memory. Do you remember a football match Nicholson arranged with I think Wimbledon College? The look on their faces when we showed up wearing old style rugby boots. Think they took it as an affront and promptly mullered us 😂
[9/3/23, 1:45:42 AM] James Eason: Does anyone remember Sprawson gobbing on the blackboard during Ma Holt’s lesson, from about three rows back aswell. It was very large, fluorescent green, and slide down the board. Skills.
[9/3/23, 2:00:44 AM] Tom Hardiment: Hi Finchie. Halesey's up for joining 👍

07710742347
[9/3/23, 2:07:21 AM] Tom Hardiment: James G and I were lined up for going to Skye but cancelled at the last minute. We were warned by someone who had been before that we should NOT go. No detail as to why but a panicked, scared and scarred look on his face said it all.
Lucky escape from the grey nylon, tight fitting trousers
[9/3/23, 2:09:20 AM] Peter Milne: Lucky escape indeed @447952310564
[9/3/23, 2:11:53 AM] Andy Glass: I saw Lucy Peary recently and he tells a great Dickie Turnbull story - Lucy had a very successful hot air balloon company and Dickie turned up at his office at Fairoaks airport for a job as a pilot, recognising Lucy’s unique name, thought the OR connection might help him - during the interview Lucy reminded him that the last time he saw him, he attacked him with a machete! He gave him the job….
[9/3/23, 2:12:07 AM] David Edwards: Brillant recall 😂…he was a very impressive gobber!
[9/3/23, 2:12:35 AM] Jon R: 😂
[9/3/23, 2:14:50 AM] William Pendered: Yes, I remember, he had a good projecting gob, worked on it quite a bit. Would be right he, was Greek? Maybe wrong?
[9/3/23, 2:22:36 AM] William Pendered: I went, 😒🙄 but had a bodyguard. Littleboy ! So not raped by Jimmy thankfully. Funny story the night before I wandered into Esher with Littleboy and about midnight saw a pub door still open. Found an unattended bar and grabbed first bottles at hand, 2 bottles of Malibu 🙄 Day of departure, all we could get for mixer was milk at breakie. First bottle lasted trip up 🤢,
[9/3/23, 2:24:58 AM] Nick Carey: That’s triggered another memory! Pix, was it you me and Bill who went on the biology field trip to Lindisfarne?
[9/3/23, 2:25:12 AM] Barry Cawston: ‘Little boy’ could pick me up by one hand round my neck 

Good bodyguard
[9/3/23, 2:26:00 AM] Barry Cawston: It was quite impressive and slightly intimidating at the same time
[9/3/23, 2:29:50 AM] Barry Cawston: Lower 6 
I handed out shots of crème de month around the common room to shouts of down the hatch 

one of them, indeed maybe more was fairy liquiiid 

To be fair it probably tasted better
[9/3/23, 2:30:31 AM] Barry Cawston: Pretty sure Chris B was a victim

[9/3/23, 8:14:38 AM] Peter Milne: Hey Zaid! I remember well our rivalry in Athletics and teamwork work in Rugby.
[9/3/23, 8:14:51 AM] Jo Chan: Yup. That was holy moly fun but we got busted.
[9/3/23, 8:15:58 AM] Mark Finch: You should not have smoked behind the bike sheds so much at school. QED. Smoking stunts growth ! That’s right eh Pixie ?! @41788323200 ?
[9/3/23, 8:23:02 AM] Mark Finch: Hey Pete, don’t rivalry forget that rivalry became teamwork too. Were you not in the England Schools 4*100 m final at Oxford ? My memory is hazy, but I think it was Rice on opening leg, then I want to say you on 2nd leg - but might have that wrong. I was certainly 3rd leg on the bend, handing off to Zaid ! We came mid-pack of about 8 and I had spent a week ~drinking~ camping in Wales on some CCF gig !  Jesus - if only we had any sort of focus at Reeds 😂😂😂
[9/3/23, 8:27:48 AM] Peter Milne: Yes. I remember that well. Great team! Teams at Reeds were brilliant. I was just thinking back to when Zaid pipped me to Victor Laudorum on Sports Day. I think @Zaid it was your long jump that did it.
[9/3/23, 8:28:49 AM] Nick Carey: That week in wales was good! The seniors getting to canoe down the river (pub by pub) instead of the hideous hike the the rest had to do! 
Also reminds me of the trip to the Peak District when Rog Moore was so desperate to overcome his fear of abseiling that he literally ran off the cliff!
[9/3/23, 8:31:05 AM] Nick Carey: “Jesus - if only we had any sort of focus at Reeds 😂😂😂”
We had plenty of focus! It was just that we were focused on drinking! 🍻🍻🍻
[9/3/23, 8:37:49 AM] Mark Finch: Haha - I was waiting for Littleboy to join but I may as well vent now. He owes me a DofE Silver ! Hickman rocked up to our tent in the new forest to “evaluate”. Sadly Littleboy had just laid a massive log about 5m from the tent and daintily put one sheet of toilet paper on top of it, covering about 10% of it. Rather than what anyone else would do and bury it ! Massive fail. Pascal and I made rolliies out of dry tealeaves and bog roll. Horrendous. It was pissing down so we thought “fuck it”, we are cheating and flagged down a van for a lift - only to find Peter Potts and team already in the friggin van ! And they got silver !! Bitter ! No not not me 😂😂😂
[9/3/23, 11:32:45 AM] Mike Nunan: That was some seriously creepy shit imo
[9/3/23, 11:33:03 AM] Mike Nunan: I dropped out of the classes fairly early doors

[9/3/23, 12:12:58 PM] Zaid Tuaima: Hi everyone. Looks like you've already got this group up and running. Lots of numbers but no name to indicate who is who. Lovely to see some old boys who I wasn't expecting to hear from again.
[9/3/23, 12:14:02 PM] Zaid Tuaima: You were braver in those days Tim.
[9/3/23, 12:17:19 PM] Peter Milne: A 40ish year old picture and a recent one. @14048044236 yours was a classic.
[9/3/23, 12:18:28 PM] Tim Clark: Not sure, i remember swinging a broom at someone who also annoyed me. Never got in to those hilarious , stupids fights people used to have behind the gym. There was even an orchestrated fight down on the pitches once…
[9/3/23, 12:19:47 PM] Zaid Tuaima: So do I. Rivals and team mates depending on what was thrown at us. BTW I didn't do long jump. My slender 14 stones wasn't ideal for jumping. My secret weapon was shot put.
[9/3/23, 12:21:46 PM] Zaid Tuaima: It might have involved me and Neil wolfie Smith.
[9/3/23, 12:25:39 PM] Tim Clark: I think it was a fake set up between Peter and someone.. we all went to the pitch, made a circle… only for Peter to pull out someone called Roger , I think… then the fight started for real … well more like a couple of drunks dancing round a handbag🤗
[9/3/23, 12:35:11 PM] Peter Potts: Nick Haigh had some seriously gnarly blisters. The leadership took pity on us and graciously offered us a ride for the final stretch. By that point, we were practically lugging Nick's backpack and might have even considered offering him a piggyback ride.
[9/3/23, 12:37:24 PM] John Vocking: I thought Nick was with us on bikes?  That was in the 5th year though so maybe there was another expedition. On a side note Pete, we were the back two in an impenetrable Hockey defence irc?
[9/3/23, 12:40:36 PM] Peter Potts: I got confirmed and almost immediately regretted it. He never did provide an answer to my serious questions. It felt like the entire process was a form of indoctrination, the kind that should be considered illegal, in my opinion.
[9/3/23, 12:45:54 PM] John Vocking: But there were biscuits. At the time that was enough for me🤣🤣
[9/3/23, 12:45:56 PM] David Edwards: Peter…wasn’t there another lad that went to Reeds in initial few years that came from Moleside and was Raab’s cousin from Jordan?
[9/3/23, 12:46:47 PM] Haydar Shawkat: Hi Pixie, Jane bumped into my sister Fatima at their school reunion I think!
[9/3/23, 12:47:04 PM] David Edwards: @40733106207 , @447957292015 you may also remember?
[9/3/23, 1:01:50 PM] Peter Milne: Rakan Nasser. I think him and his cousin were in the Jordanian Royal Family.
[9/3/23, 1:03:09 PM] Peter Milne: That was it. My blurry memory is becoming clearer now😃
[9/3/23, 1:07:47 PM] James Eason: Yes, Rakan it was indeed; he did a few years in Shack I recall - nice fellow.  Was in Capel.
[9/3/23, 1:08:31 PM] David Edwards: Thought so…@447917428535 another one to add to the list!
[9/3/23, 1:09:14 PM] Peter Milne: I heard a while ago that he died in a plane or car crash. I hope I am wrong.
[9/3/23, 1:10:10 PM] David Edwards: Wow, that is tragic, as u said, I hope you are wrong!

He was and still is the only Jordanian to speak with a heavy south London accent. RIP Ratta Natta.

[9/3/23, 11:47:31 PM] Mark Finch: What a way to start a Monday !! Welcome Paul “Willie” Rushton !!! Thanks Pascal @34676264906
[9/3/23, 11:59:32 PM] David Edwards: @447495602526 @447957292015 @40733106207…. Did Simon? Henderson also come to Reeds from Moleside? I seem to think he was in Mullens? His older brother was Jeremy I think?
[9/4/23, 12:01:22 AM] Dave Wilko: He used to live opposite the mole river just as you came into Cobham?
[9/4/23, 12:02:52 AM] David Edwards: Good memory… but did he end up going to Reeds?
[9/4/23, 12:05:46 AM] Mark Finch: No I don’t think so and he’s not on any of the Reeder leaving lists !  It bizarrely I bumped into Robbie Henderson’s Brother in law on Saturday night !! (Robbie was St Johnian in our year). You’re not thinking of Robbie are you ? ‎<This message was edited>
[9/4/23, 12:10:05 AM] David Edwards: Nooo….different Henderson family.
[9/4/23, 12:10:31 AM] Dave Wilko: Yeh I think you are right and he didn’t go on to Reeds
[9/4/23, 12:13:17 AM] Barry Cawston: Dave E where are you now .. heading to a rugby match ?
[9/4/23, 12:24:07 AM] Chris: But didn't he have a younger brother? Mickey???
[9/4/23, 12:24:50 AM] Tom Hardiment: Simon Hendo Henderson was year below us in Mullens. Jeremey was the year above. Both good actors. Jeremey too lazy to learn his lines put them all around the stage to read off.

Bit like our 3rd form house unison redition of Libiamo when 6th form had the lyrics stuck to the kids in front. The teachers and judge saw as we walked off. We also sung the 1st vetse twice cos we didn't manage to do the 2nd. Most were told to mime. Judge gave us 1 out of 20. Said it was the worst thing he had ever heard. Geoff v angry, said he'd never been so embarrassed
[9/4/23, 12:26:39 AM] David Edwards: Yep…currently 3 hours south of Calais and on route to Marseilles. Are u planning to head over as well?
[9/4/23, 12:32:42 AM] Mark Finch: I remember it was sung with much gusto !!! A classic !
[9/4/23, 12:33:28 AM] Barry Cawston: Ha ha great memory Tom except in the audience it was pretty obvious from the outset that some shenanigans was going on  😁
[9/4/23, 12:34:53 AM] Barry Cawston: @447768686201 No can do as I have a BBC film crew shooting a drama in the drugstore this week… enjoy the craic
[9/4/23, 12:37:51 AM] Paul Rushton: Thanks Mark. Good picture, not changed. Bit!
[9/4/23, 12:39:43 AM] Tom Hardiment: Who's idea was it to ask the likes of Turnbull, Terry Gillyer Glass snr, Tim Taylor etc to sing in Italian.
Like asking thr Cray twins to open the village fete
[9/4/23, 12:39:51 AM] Mark Finch: Nor have you - up to your eyebrows ;-)
[9/4/23, 12:46:03 AM] Barry Cawston: @447952310564 The Mafia
[9/4/23, 12:47:33 AM] Jon R: Judge jury and executioner if called to MS3
[9/4/23, 12:59:08 AM] John Vocking: Didn’t we all have to go into Geoffreys room and recite the words at some point?  What’s annoying is i can still recite that first verse perfectly and it’s my bloody earworm for today 😔
[9/4/23, 1:00:46 AM] John Vocking: Irc the weapon of choice was a sock filled with some D cell batteries ☹️
[9/4/23, 1:03:07 AM] Jon R: Dorm raids when they obviously had an otherwise dull evening
[9/4/23, 1:06:47 AM] John Vocking: Flipping out of bed with you mattress landing on top of you to protect from Glass Senior trying to kick your head in. Occasionally having to resort to running across the dining room roof😳
[9/4/23, 1:07:25 AM] Nick Carey: We only went and redid it in the upper sixth! That’s why I can still remember it - and I was bloody miming! 🤣
[9/4/23, 1:07:47 AM] Nick Carey: Your idea Tom iirc?
[9/4/23, 1:19:57 AM] Tom Hardiment: Sorry John.
I hum it most days.

Nick you're right:
 I was house music captain in 6 two when Rob Lee (on piano) and I (ALL Rob's idea) chose Libiamo to sing again... Worst 4 weeks of my school career rehearsing that
[9/4/23, 1:22:24 AM] Andy Glass: Just want to mention Glass snr didn’t spare me either! Seem to remember we dismantled James Myers’ bed and reassembled it on the dining room roof and we had a few head butt competitions which probably accounts for the memory gaps…
[9/4/23, 1:22:59 AM] Tom Hardiment: Like buying tickets on the titanic knowing what was going to happen
[9/4/23, 1:24:28 AM] Andy Glass: Did we sing both verses that time?
[9/4/23, 1:27:10 AM] John Vocking: Yes I remember that. That roof got an awful lot of foot traffic 😎 I also remember Glass senior (Chris?) dealing out some special treatment to you Andy. I seen to recall you saying “He’s different at home”🤣
[9/4/23, 1:28:27 AM] Tom Hardiment: Not sure.
Traumatic amnesia.
It was one year the judge stopped us after we crumbled mid first verse and said why don't you all take a moment and try again
[9/4/23, 1:28:40 AM] Andy Glass: That may have been a coping mechanism! He is as meek as a lamb these days…
[9/4/23, 1:32:44 AM] Tom Hardiment: Can't see the Reed's kids doing this stuff nowadays. 
Too busy helping the school get 98% A to A* A level results
[9/4/23, 1:33:50 AM] Andy Glass: Did anyone on this chat get an A?
[9/4/23, 1:34:33 AM] Andrew Marsh: Is that A for absent ?
[9/4/23, 1:35:19 AM] Tom Hardiment: I got an A for art. Does that count?
[9/4/23, 1:35:25 AM] David Edwards: Haha…so you foepar on sharing on social too early didn’t scupper the deal! 😂
[9/4/23, 1:39:49 AM] Mark Finch: Was that just after he retired from professional boxing ?! 😂
[9/4/23, 1:39:59 AM] David Edwards: The joys of bullying….never had it so good! One of my fondest memories is Glass Snr used to thump me downwards in the top of my head while in the tuck shop queue, then place his order of a double decker! Plus u could of been there for 10 mins waiting and seniors would ‘dish’ you! 🤪
[9/4/23, 1:40:39 AM] Andy Glass: You were always his favourite ❤️
[9/4/23, 1:43:12 AM] Barry Cawston: To curve the thread in 3rd form I got really angry one day with Oni and punched him full on in the face 

Any one care to guess what happened next ?
[9/4/23, 1:44:39 AM] Mark Finch: Ouch, ouch, ouch !!! 😂
[9/4/23, 1:58:47 AM] Nick Carey: Remember playing Capel in the jnr house rugby and being very proud of stopping Oni kicking the potentially winning drop goal by grabbing his arm (it went wide) - the truth is if I could reach his arm I was close enough to tackle him properly but bottled it! 🫣
[9/4/23, 1:59:24 AM] Andy Glass: No shame in that Nick!
[9/4/23, 2:00:43 AM] Tom Hardiment: I faced him as scrum half for house  rugby in 6th form. Cacking myself. Needn't of worried.
Turns out he was only dangerous when running at speed. Bit top heavy when stationary and a bit slow with delivery
[9/4/23, 2:02:41 AM] Andy Glass: Zaid and Ony dancing at the Walton Hop… Night to Remember! Do you still remember the routine Zaid?
[9/4/23, 2:04:01 AM] Barry Cawston: And Zenons
[9/4/23, 2:05:51 AM] Nick Carey: Jeez, went there once - talk about a fish out of water! 
I think I was the definition of anti-cool! 🤣
[9/4/23, 3:26:35 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: Only once for me too, Zaid’s birthday.
Went with you and Nick H - I was wearing your clothes, so perhaps I might get the definition! 😜
[9/4/23, 4:47:59 AM] Nick Carey: Holy cow! I cannot imagine a world in which anybody would have chosen something out of my wardrobe over their own! However, I can guarantee you will have looked better in it than I would have! 🤣
I have a vague memory of feeling the need to get some liquid courage inside 
me but only being able to afford one (maybe 2?) drinks! 
I do remember Nick H driving us up there though!
[9/4/23, 4:51:11 AM] Jon R: Now that is a missed photo opportunity-Dunc in Nicks togs…?!!
[9/4/23, 7:17:56 AM] Pascal: 🫣
[9/4/23, 10:01:46 AM] Steve Gates: I think I got an A in English and Geography, and even got an S level in Geography - which I think shocked Savage. And then got a D in Economics Thankyou Rome… 😂😂😂
[9/4/23, 10:09:09 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: Good job mobile phones hadn’t been invented yet!
[9/4/23, 11:01:36 AM] Jon R: You didn’t find a porno mag in one of the pockets then?
[9/4/23, 12:53:21 PM] Tim Clark: Same thing that happened to you when you got a cricket ball in your face!!! Bruising Barry we should have called you… Did anyone NOT get injured in sports?
[9/4/23, 1:00:16 PM] John Vocking: I had my fair share, ear nearly ripped off, obligatory knee wounds from that bloody redgra all weather pitch and finally being concussed during rugby training. I came round and could not remember any of the subject i was to be taking at  O level that year. But could remember @14048044236  name😳. Slept for 40hrs in sick wing. 
Only found out last year, when going though my mums papers, that the school apologised and were reprimanded for not sending me to hospital for a scan.  
And i think i might have put a stud through @447771308270 skull ?
Sorry AD
‎[9/4/23, 1:02:57 PM] Tim Clark: ‎<attached: 00000636-GIF-2023-09-04-13-02-57.mp4>
[9/4/23, 1:04:25 PM] Nick Carey: Broken collar bone (rugby), broken nose (house waterpolo - Dave’s namesake in blathwaite a year above us), sprained ankle (rugby). 
None as good as the injury that got me into the hockey 2nd xi though! Lucy getting 3rd degree burns on a sunbed! 🤣
[9/4/23, 1:05:20 PM] Graham Hales: My children were brought up on x2 stories of @447771308270. In the first one he lent over a Bunsen burnet and his hair caught fire. In the second he glasses misted on Monument Hill whilst riding a bike; he bounced twice before he started rolling. Amazed he’s still with us
[9/4/23, 1:07:07 PM] Tim Clark: There was house waterpolo? Didn’t get that memo.
[9/4/23, 1:10:44 PM] Mark Finch: OMG. I’ve just remembered the worst I have ever witnessed !! Pascal was a handy bowler. Kind of mid paced swinger if I remember (nothing changes eh !). Can’t remember who was batting in the nets - maybe Garfield Hatton. Who ever it was drove one of the most powerful shots I have ever seen. Pasc had no chance of moving. Leather connected to scrotum. I swear I saw one of his balls pop out one of his nostrils momentarily. But the nightmare was the deep scream. A moan replicated in many horror movies since. Even sister Keenies blue gargle didn’t do the trick and he was carted off to hospital wimpering. 
Remember that @34676264906 ?! ‎<This message was edited>
[9/4/23, 1:11:12 PM] James Eason: Loads of injuries; at 12 on the Coombe rugby pitch during a game I found a 50p piece sized shard of pottery sticking out of my knee, effing sore but Eric or some wise-guy told me to carry on. Okay I did but needed 6 stitches later. Also I remember nutting Lungmuss with a  filthy beamer; that was quite messy.
[9/4/23, 1:17:18 PM] Mark Finch: Haha ! Fred Shawkat was our secret weapon
[9/4/23, 1:17:42 PM] Mark Finch: @447786337137
[9/4/23, 1:18:39 PM] Andrew Shiells: It was Sir Garfield Hatton not sobers but hit with the same power! I remember trying to sweep a full toss that hit the back of the bat then my eyebrow that meant cycling home was like Nelson for the next two weeks! Still never worn a helmet 😱🤕
[9/4/23, 1:21:20 PM] Paul Rushton: It was Garfield Hatton, Pascal was in sick wing for at least 4 days with balls the size of a Melon, quite extraordinary he has managed to father 3 children.
[9/4/23, 1:30:10 PM] Paul Rushton: John I think there was another rugby injury you haven’t shared?
[9/4/23, 1:43:46 PM] John Vocking: Now I’m intrigued 😳
[9/4/23, 1:45:33 PM] Paul Rushton: Was it not you who received a few stitches in the hairy walnut after being raked ?
[9/4/23, 1:46:23 PM] John Vocking: 🤣🤣 No, not me. I’m sure I’d remember that😫
[9/4/23, 1:48:22 PM] John Vocking: Maybe it was @34676264906   That seems to be his area of expertise 😉
[9/4/23, 2:03:08 PM] Tom Hardiment: Sorry to remind you Pixie but your broken wrist mid autumn term got me instant promotion to 1st XV scrum half for 2 or 3 games. I learnt what contact sport meant. Got to wear an expensive rugby shirt with a number on the back tho. Glad when you came back after half term.
[9/4/23, 2:11:02 PM] Peter Milne: Broken nose in rugby, almost at right angles to where it should have been. Hospital, knocked back into place, large cast put over it. My nose was big enough as it is!!!!
[9/4/23, 2:13:42 PM] Peter Milne: It was an accidental elbow from somebody in the same team. Or maybe it was a house match. The name will come to me eventually.
[9/4/23, 10:02:27 PM] Pascal: Vivid for 5 seconds then woke up in the ward with matron
[9/4/23, 10:03:48 PM] Pascal: Not a broken nose but dislodged. Taken to hospital where it was snapped into the correct position.
[9/4/23, 10:24:02 PM] William Pendered: Remember both locations and "the dance". As for Walton Hop. I'm hoping all escaped some of the depraved things that emerged in the press 5 or so years back, was it Jonathan King deviant??
[9/4/23, 11:11:42 PM] James Eason: Didn’t we have a disco/party for someone at the Oxshott Village Hall? Zaid was in an Adam Ant costume?
[9/4/23, 11:12:49 PM] William Pendered: Spot on Tom, think that was my worst one. Other than a dislocated finger at cricket 🙄 likely lots concussions but that was never counted in those days, usually told to get on with it
[9/4/23, 11:18:34 PM] Zaid Tuaima: Wow....I had an Adam Ant costume?? That must have been very early on in our Reeds timeframe. I know we have had some famous tennis players, classical musicians and actor (Tom Hardy) go through Reeds over the years but have we had any pop stars amongst the Reeds Alumnae? I do recall Stuart Ebdon (I think it was his name) was a very talented drummer and blew everyone away in the inter house music comp one year.
[9/4/23, 11:19:40 PM] Barry Cawston: @447816878714 yep cricket ball in the face from 5yds 
The next day was the school photo .. 

Then 8 yrs later softball in the face from 5yds 

Karma?
[9/4/23, 11:21:36 PM] Zaid Tuaima: There was no routine. We just winged it. Having said that I did spend most of my spare time from the ages of 15 to 20 in nightclubs/discos so it was bond to happen.
[9/4/23, 11:22:13 PM] Zaid Tuaima: BTW am I the only day boy in the group?
[9/4/23, 11:29:40 PM] James Eason: There’s a good few of us in here; surnames for brevity: Edwards, Milne, McDonald, Piers-Mahoney, Me, Wilkinson, Attwell.
[9/4/23, 11:31:00 PM] S-P: I was a day boy too, and whilst I was not a high performing rugby player like you guys, I did enjoy it.  Being slight I was a flanker and one October the day before half term I ended up under the scum somehow, twisting my arm in the process. It hurt but I thought nothing of it, and played on to the whistle, but by then it was excrutiating. So I went to sickbay and nurse told me to soak it in warm water with a view to going home. They called my mum and next thing she was at school with Guy's mum, Lesley. [Guy was also a day boy] We were due to go to Florida the next day so it was agreed I would go to Epsom A&E. When I got there my right wrist was fractured and my elbow chipped. I got a cast and we flew out the next day. I'm not quite sure what the outcome would have been had the trip to the US not prompted a visit to A&E. I got back on the field for the rest of that term once my arm had healed.
[9/4/23, 11:31:25 PM] Zaid Tuaima: Good to know that I'm not the only day in the village.
[9/4/23, 11:32:43 PM] James Eason: Proud to be Day.
[9/4/23, 11:46:26 PM] Tom Hardiment: Yeh. Approach to injury was appalling. Sure A-D was unconscious for a minute after nutting the metal rugby post.
Don Cameron (another day boy Zaid) dislocated or broke his shoulder playing for Mullens. Geoff just told him to walk up to sick bay on his own. He could of passed out. Insult to injury Geoff charged his parents for the cost of the rugby shirt A&E had to cut it off to operate...
[9/5/23, 12:02:40 AM] Peter Milne: You a doctor @34676264906 ? Was it your elbow? No blame, just curious.
[9/5/23, 12:09:24 AM] Tom Hardiment: Sorry Zaid. Don C is not in the group yet but Nick Carey and Graham Rice are a few other day boys to add to the list.
[9/5/23, 12:10:32 AM] John Vocking: Didn’t the Mullens Day Boys have their own small common room under the stairs?
[9/5/23, 12:14:20 AM] Peter Milne: Jan Alkema, who was in a local heavy metal band called Crucifix(aka Titan)with my brother, became a really talented drummer and did some sessions and recordings with other bands.
[9/5/23, 12:22:40 AM] Tom Hardiment: Dolly Orr's older brother had a heavy metal band. He played on the stage when we were in the 3rd form. Load of us head banging at the front. Fecked my neck up. Couldn't move my head for 3 days.
Saw him on a pub in London about 3 years ago. Still had long hair. He said he carried on playing and took the band on the road. Not sure which road. Probably Cobham High St
[9/5/23, 12:25:04 AM] Barry Cawston: Do you mean Paul Orr … he ended up playing the lead on stage in The Rocky Horror picture show for several years … sounded like it was a proper rock  n roll craic
[9/5/23, 12:25:11 AM] Nick Carey: In the 5th year, yes, me Don & Gregor… great little spot 😁
[9/5/23, 12:25:47 AM] Nick Carey: Also proud to be day 😁
[9/5/23, 12:26:48 AM] Mark Finch: Not so much a costume - more dressed the same as Adam Ant with the wide shouldered jacked, baggy black trousers and the same make up. I can vouch for that as I was invited back to your place quite a few times to practice ! While the dancing was quite impressive - what was more impressive is that you had a SodaStream which - as a boarder going back to the middle east all the time - was like a river of gold to me. Coke made from water and syrup and carbonated. That was the real miracle - not that you could look like Adam Ant !

Luckily Kraftwork has not re-leased “He’s a model and he’s looking good…danana nanana na … na na..” and it has not been sampled - as I wouldn’t be able to get that dance out my head ! 😂
[9/5/23, 12:27:20 AM] Barry Cawston: Anyone heard from Don … lovely guy. 
He and I both had ME in upper 6th mine eased after taking two years off but I know Don suffered with it very badly for some time …
[9/5/23, 12:27:30 AM] Nick Carey: Really nasty collar bone break - knitted back together in an overlap 🤮 ‎<This message was edited>
[9/5/23, 12:27:38 AM] Peter Milne: Paul also played in Crucifix. They used to practise in the cellar of my home.
[9/5/23, 12:30:00 AM] Mark Finch: I tried a bit of Googling - but “incredibly good golfer, probably professional, from Reeds, called Don”. Didn’t quit cut it it. Google can be rubbish sometimes !
[9/5/23, 12:31:23 AM] Nick Carey: Yeah, lovely chap with a wonderfully dour Scottish sense of humour… Finchie has contact details for his brother but no news yet I think
[9/5/23, 12:32:28 AM] Mark Finch: Nowt back yet ! His brother probably thinks I’m a weird stalker !
[9/5/23, 12:32:49 AM] Barry Cawston: He was v funny and yes scratch golfer but at 21 his ME was awful couldn’t work etc etc
[9/5/23, 12:33:24 AM] Barry Cawston: Always wished him well …
[9/5/23, 12:34:31 AM] Mark Finch: This is one of the biggest surprises - you were a day boy Nick !!! I would have bet my house you were a boarder. You certainly drank like a boarder (no offence to others !) !!! ‎<This message was edited>
[9/5/23, 12:35:37 AM] Nick Carey: That one of the nicest things anyone’s ever said to me 😊
[9/5/23, 12:35:46 AM] Nick Carey: Hahaha!
[9/5/23, 12:37:00 AM] Nick Carey: I boarded for the summer term in 6-1 but otherwise a day boy all the way through… I was usually at school til 9/10 o’clock most days though!
[9/5/23, 12:37:15 AM] Barry Cawston: 😁🕺🏻😁
[9/5/23, 12:39:08 AM] Barry Cawston: For me it was the other way round … used to sneak home with mates, clear my folks larder and then head back to Reed’s for tea!
[9/5/23, 12:39:27 AM] Tom Hardiment: Yeh Paul Orr!
We had a good catch-up. Said he's been in the business for years. Nice guy
[9/5/23, 12:39:55 AM] Barry Cawston: He was classic …
[9/5/23, 12:41:12 AM] Haydar Shawkat: I remember tackling Rhino (Dave Rhind) in a house match and I’m sure he was concussed but we just carried on….luckily the threatened post game retribution from his teammates never happened 😀
[9/5/23, 12:42:01 AM] Barry Cawston: Anyone remember the crazy party at mine which was gate crashed by skinheads, Garfield lying down in the road and the house being wrecked
[9/5/23, 12:42:11 AM] Mark Finch: 😂 I rember being fed at your place many times. A godsend !
[9/5/23, 12:43:51 AM] Barry Cawston: Jack and Wendy … saved the day on several occasions 

Jack also got a cricket ball in the face at Reed’s whilst watching a match 
Obviously runs in the family 😁
[9/5/23, 12:45:41 AM] Malcolm: No I'm here as well, even though I did not make it to the end
[9/5/23, 1:08:38 AM] Tom Hardiment: If it's the game I remember I was standing 10yds away at square leg. You were silly mid on i think. I saw heard the impact.
No helmets in those days! 😞
[9/5/23, 1:09:03 AM] Mark Finch: Zaid, that’s Malcolm MacDonald in case you’re not keeping contacts up to date ;-)
[9/5/23, 1:25:13 AM] David Edwards: Nope… I was a Day Boy as well! From memory, the day boys on this Group are Peter Milne, Dave Wilkinson (left early) Malcolm (left early) Neil ‘Wolfie’ Smith, Simon Piers Mahoney, Nick Carey and James Eason….defo not the only day boy in the village!
[9/5/23, 1:35:56 AM] Peter Milne: I think I had the shortest trip home. 5 minutes down the path.
[9/5/23, 2:35:55 AM] Malcolm: Mine was about the same to the bottom of Birchvale, I remember a few Bristowe borders, Pixie in particular coming over for mums baking
[9/5/23, 5:03:23 AM] Andrew Shiells: And me Andy Shiells, aka Shiellsy or Shiella depending on which friendship group rather than any special night or persuasion 😜
[9/5/23, 6:06:55 AM] William Pendered: Was very nice too 😋
[9/5/23, 6:09:39 AM] William Pendered: Yes, your Mum was very good at it 👍😁
[9/5/23, 6:30:15 AM] Andrew Shiells: I’m playing golf 9.40 tee off next Wednesday 13th at Tyrrells Wood in LEATHERHEAD with Andy Glass and Dave Wilkinson room for 1 more if anyone can? 🏌️‍♂️😎
[9/5/23, 9:23:16 AM] Pascal: Visited him after Reeds In Scotland
[9/5/23, 9:25:01 AM] Pascal: Can't. Still do that out-of-date stuff called work 😉. Can't seem to shake it off.
[9/5/23, 9:26:22 AM] Barry Cawston: Wandering when that was Pasc and how he was getting on?
[9/5/23, 9:29:31 AM] Andrew Shiells: You promised to have lessons so you could come on our tour! 🤗
[9/5/23, 9:30:56 AM] Pascal: As for concussion, i remember going out to warm.up on a the small rugby pitch by the close and at the first tackle went down and hit my head on the rock hard earth. Knocked out. Can't remember if I was taken away or told to play on.  In any case, it made no sense to play on the pitch that day. I also remember playing a game in fog and no-one could see the ball or the players. They would just appear and disappear again.
[9/5/23, 9:31:15 AM] Pascal: 😂😂
[9/5/23, 9:32:03 AM] Pascal: I tried because I met a lovely golfer but lockdown came and the incentive disappeared. 🥲
[9/5/23, 9:32:04 AM] Mark Finch: I think Barry meant “when you met Don” - nowt to do with golf ;-) ‎<This message was edited>
[9/5/23, 9:32:41 AM] Barry Cawston: Pasc I remember that game it was hilarious like playing rugby with ghosts
[9/5/23, 9:32:50 AM] Pascal: Ages ago
[9/5/23, 9:33:19 AM] Pascal: I think I might have a contact.
[9/5/23, 9:33:56 AM] Pascal: No. Thought I did.
[9/5/23, 10:37:07 AM] Nick Haigh: There were two - the first (silver) was cycling in the new Forest and I seem to remember spending a disqualifying amount of time in pubs and not getting caught!   Then the gold was in the 6th I think and that was crazy hiking.  Some of us had bought second hand German para boots from some surplus store that were not worn in - the cause of the blistering :)
[9/5/23, 10:58:42 AM] Peter Potts: My mind must be rewriting history. I remember that our backpacks were crazy heavy and that the following year, the official rules stated that backpacks must not exceed 1/2 the weight we had.
[9/5/23, 12:32:57 PM] Pascal: Backpacks were 15-20 kilos

[9/5/23, 12:47:54 PM] Jon R: And Sugar Loaf mountain to finish with….somebody’s idea of a joke!
[9/5/23, 12:51:41 PM] Pascal: We had to spend a night out in a tin foil bivouac Wet and frozen all night, no sleep. Part of the training.
[9/5/23, 12:52:32 PM] Andrew Shiells: We were definitely born in the era to make or break you and have some memorable scars and war wounds! I’ve worked at Reeds in the med centre for the last 14 years treating sports injuries twice a week for the kids. I changed from banking to osteopathy in 2001 and never looked back. Guess the love of sport and lack of care at school hatched the business plan. They’ve now moved on to hiring a head injury doctor and a team of physios so matron doesn’t have to get her hands on the boys!! In the world of litigation rugby in schools is under threat but team bonding and life stories as we’ve had on this group also gets threatened. Safety and management is key but hopefully the easy path of banning it is resisted. Think CCF and DofE also have a week of risk assessments first ! Boring 😜
[9/5/23, 12:52:57 PM] Jon R: I was with Geng Coombs who carried the kitchen sink. Walked behind him and thought the sun had gone in
[9/5/23, 12:53:09 PM] John Vocking: We spent more time in the pub than our tent for the silver one. Ralston provided cb’s so we could keep a remote check on masters coming to check on us. Who was in that team?  You (NH), me , AD?  JR? RH and Mark Justesen? ‎<This message was edited>
[9/5/23, 8:09:17 PM] William Pendered: I remember the match on a good 3 inches of snow 🙄
[9/5/23, 8:11:10 PM] William Pendered: Great Pic Pascal 👍
[9/5/23, 11:19:29 PM] ~ Mark: Lordy that brings back memories. And those German para boots 😫
[9/6/23, 12:05:59 AM] Kin: That was me taking refuge from the cold !!! What great pics bringing back fond memories
[9/6/23, 12:41:58 AM] Mark Finch: How topical ! Despite our teams abject failure at Silver D of E, what a great thing to do ! I came across this great article from our very Tom Hardiment @447952310564 in the Reeder Magazine last year ..

[9/6/23, 12:44:05 AM] Mark Finch: Nice tie BTW !
[9/6/23, 2:02:49 AM] Tom Hardiment: Pure gold! Thanks a million Pascal.
Can't believe you have these.

You, me, Mark  F, James G and Rob Lee. Rob must have taken all the photos as he's in none of then except the 'who's hidding in there' one.
In the one where you're saluting I'm on picture left. The packs were defo 25kg+. Someone had to put them on your back for you. Minus 5 at night but unforgettable sunrises. A few well earned pints at Llanthony at the end.
🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺

Cheers,
T
[9/6/23, 2:03:33 AM] Tom Hardiment: Thanks for the free promo Finchie
[9/6/23, 2:06:05 AM] Tom Hardiment: Hi John. I was in the cycle group too. We got up.late, only cycled an hour a day and spent the arvo in pubs. The walkers had 5+ hours hiking in the rain.
[9/6/23, 2:07:03 AM] Mark Finch: To be clear. I either wasn’t there or had concussion for two weeks (pretty sure it was the former) ! I think I used to rock up and do community service for a some disabled kids in Epsom when you guys were doing DofE training !!!
[9/6/23, 2:08:05 AM] Mark Finch: <cough> 30 minutes in the back of a van we flagged down. I think we were in the pub early ;-)
[9/6/23, 2:09:05 AM] Mark Finch: The more I read this thread, the more I understand my academic under achievement 😂😂😂
[9/6/23, 2:14:39 AM] Barry Cawston: It certainly appears that there are some common threads or is that threds?
[9/6/23, 2:17:13 AM] Alex Coomes: Reading all the this banter only affirms my belief that our School was basically an open prison for adolescent men if today’s youth were treated in the same manner the teachers would be held up for child abuse! We did, however, all survive the experience. I put my ability to eat food at a lightning speed down to the dinner sittings we had to endure with teachers standing over us barking orders at us to eat up or we would be thrown out of the dinner hall - Mr Steadman housemaster of Capel springs to mind
[9/6/23, 2:18:32 AM] Mark Finch: Great to hear from you Alex Coomes @447802316389 !
[9/6/23, 2:19:46 AM] Alex Coomes: Just having to do my VAT return today - this is more interesting than looking at excel spreadsheet!!!!
[9/6/23, 2:21:35 AM] Mark Finch: On the reunion weekend (see what I did there) - we definitely need to take in your own local hostelry - tell everyone about it - super cool  !
[9/6/23, 2:22:55 AM] Peter Milne: Definitely some dodgy teachers, completely insane kitchen staff, and I am sure the beef was actually horse meat!
[9/6/23, 2:28:53 AM] Alex Coomes: More than happy to welcome OR’s to Platform 3  some of the present teachers drown their sorrows with my beer as the Victoria is now an up-market Gastropub serving overpriced food to the Chelsea footballers wives and their tennis coaches
[9/6/23, 2:30:08 AM] Jon R: Didn’t see many dogs in the area…just saying
[9/6/23, 2:46:17 AM] Mark Finch: At Claygate station right ? @447802316389.
Maybe we swing by the Hare & Hounds for old time sake (wonder if the juke box is still there ?). And if Nev Stevens ever gets back to me - pop into the Griffin to celebrate the first ever pint I was bought by his old man at the age of 14 !!!
[9/6/23, 2:56:22 AM] Alex Coomes: Yes, my Brewery Tap  Platform 3 next to station we are open Thursday- Sunday weather permitting as drinking is all outside believe it is smallest licenced pub in Uk has inside seating for 1 drinker
[9/6/23, 5:42:34 AM] Alex Coomes: T
[9/6/23, 5:53:17 AM] Jo Chan: Hi Alex. How r u. Your summary is awesome. So bloody well written. Mr Wright taught u well. Lol.
[9/6/23, 6:22:17 AM] Alex Coomes: Now running my own microbrewery in Claygate with small brewery tap “Platform 3” my career has had three parts to it (so far) 1. Working for posh party planner in London called  William Bartholomew 2. Spent 18 years working at Hedge fund for a megalomaniac 3. Running my own business brewing beer which is much harder than you can possibly imagine
[9/6/23, 6:26:11 AM] Barry Cawston: Oh I think most of us can imagine ! 🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻
[9/6/23, 6:27:54 AM] Tom Hardiment: Hi Alex.
Looking fwd to trying a pint or two next June.
You still playing the trumpet?
Best thing about the orchestra was getting pulled out of prep every Wednesday night for rehearsals.
[9/6/23, 6:37:45 AM] Alex Coomes: Ahh, those where the days.. . . Have very little time for music too busy doing other activities however what I learnt at Reed’s helped me rock plenty of dance floors with banging tunes in many dubious nightclubs and marquees all over Uk and beyond. Coulsden  died very young a melanoma or something really ghastly. Head of music Hoskins is apparently still alive in Yorkshire no doubt still drinking plenty of cheap Sherry. Still remember Libiamo house unison as a complete and utter shambles!
[9/6/23, 7:21:37 AM] Tom Hardiment: Yes, Graham is still with us. I was visiting my 80 year old aunt at xmas in Holt, Norfolk 10 or 11 years ago. She said a friend is coming for a sherry at noon. Door bell goes. Feck me. Hoskins walks in through the front door. He looks at me for a few seconds and says "Tom?"
"Yes... Mr Hoskins?"
"I think you can call me Graham now Tom"

Turns out he taught at the local school, Greshams, and ran the local choir where my aunt sung.

He stayed an hour or so. Had about 6 sherries.

Back in the day I remember him one time falling backwards off the stage from the piano stool while accompanying a soloist. Got back up smilling at the audience.

All the teachers were wrecked for Saturday morning lessons. Told us to copy something from a book while they rocked in the corner...
[9/6/23, 4:40:46 PM] Roger Attwell: @447768686201 are you going to the game in Nice?
[9/6/23, 7:39:29 PM] William Pendered: Hi Roger, how you doing? Dave's at Marseille game this weekend v Argies but not Nice. I will likely be in Nice tho. I don't have ticket (yet), but know of some category 1 tickets at Eur 300 that still be available if you or others interested??
[9/6/23, 11:21:11 PM] David Edwards: As Pix says, will be in Marseille by this afternoon. Also meeting up with Andy G in Lille for Chile game. Are you planning on going at all?
[9/7/23, 5:35:46 AM] Roger Attwell: I didn’t plan on going at all, wasn’t even thinking about when we planned our trip(totally messed that up, would have could have etc)but will be in Nice the day after the game before heading down to Cannes for a few days was just wondering if anyone would still be around the area for a few days after the game.
[9/7/23, 7:48:10 AM] David Edwards: 🥴…unfortunately we are heading in the opposite direction after the game. However hope ours paths cross again soon!
[9/7/23, 12:00:13 PM] Roger Attwell: Did anyone go to Stubbington House Prep before Reeds?
[9/7/23, 12:28:50 PM] Andy Glass: Yes! Berty  and Johnny Manser, Bruce Hodgson and Chris and I
[9/7/23, 12:29:44 PM] Roger Attwell: Remember Andy Straker?
[9/7/23, 12:30:10 PM] Andy Glass: Yes of course - good bowler!
[9/7/23, 12:30:40 PM] Andy Glass: Are you in contact with him?
[9/7/23, 12:31:00 PM] Roger Attwell: He lives 3 miles away
[9/7/23, 12:31:31 PM] John Vocking: Bertie left after the 3rd year didn’t he?  There was also Rawlings too, can’t remember when he left.
[9/7/23, 12:42:24 PM] Andy Glass: Yes Berty just didn’t settle in - not sure about when Rawlings left
[9/7/23, 12:46:38 PM] John Vocking: Must have been around the same time, don’t think he was there in the 4th year.  I remember being really surprised that Bertie decided to leave as he seemed to have integrated really well. 

I can still see the L shaped dormitory layout in my head, and who was where. 🤣
[9/7/23, 1:10:13 PM] Tom Hardiment: We were in that dorm for 3 straight years. Different bed each year. Ralston with his portable vhs: Exorcist, The Omen...
[9/7/23, 1:10:49 PM] John Vocking: Don’t forget Carrie too.
[9/7/23, 1:13:56 PM] Roger Attwell: Never seen that attribute in the 30 years I’ve known him!
[9/7/23, 1:25:47 PM] Andy Glass: Ralston showed some early entrepreneurial talent by copying Bo Derek 10 and selling it for a fiver - obvs very popular
[9/7/23, 1:27:04 PM] Andy Glass: He had an odd action, used to curl up his arm before delivery… funny what you remember….
[9/7/23, 1:27:18 PM] Roger Attwell: A Fiver seems rather expensive?
[9/7/23, 1:28:44 PM] Roger Attwell: I’m sending him a screenshot of your comment.
[9/7/23, 1:30:38 PM] Roger Attwell: Actually isn’t that modern spin bowlers do now?
[9/7/23, 1:41:37 PM] Mark Finch: This is brilliant - I had no idea about these stories - make me chuckle !
[9/7/23, 1:45:25 PM] Mark Finch: Let me add - porn king - Jerry Chipchase ! Could get anything - club international (quality photos), Razzler (a bit rough) etc. etc. My personal favourite - Fiesta - always love a good story !!! 
Not sure why the GYNAECOLOGIST in Adelaide is not responding to my requests to connect 😂😂😂
[9/7/23, 1:50:17 PM] Tom Hardiment: Probably just up to his elbows at work
‎[9/7/23, 1:57:37 PM] Mark Finch: ‎<attached: 00000794-PHOTO-2023-09-07-13-57-37.jpg>
[9/7/23, 4:11:02 PM] Roger Attwell: Talking about porn reminds me of when I came back to Reeds roughly 15 years later as the demolition and earthworks contractor when they started selling the land adjacent to Sandy Lane to developers, Banner Homes I think were the first. 

Carried out the demolition of Assistant Headmaster’s house(a white house on an exit only road onto Sandy Lane?) there was a stash of porn mags and videos in the attic that would have stocked a shop in Soho at the time, at which point I thought “and you taught us!”
The next part of the contract was digging up the sacred grass hockey pitch near to The Close that we were told as pupils was one of the finest in the country….it took 30 seconds to undo that legacy!
[9/8/23, 12:28:27 AM] Mike Nunan: Oh yes - he used to go by his middle name "Vill" (Willem or similar in full) didn't he? Went to him for a few drum lessons, but to no great avail, I was still shit and no chance of turning into Neil Peart. Kept up playing into uni a little bit but then didn't have a kit, then eventually switched to collecting records, far less demanding of any real musical talent 😏
[9/8/23, 1:21:52 AM] Peter Milne: I saw him a few months ago and he hasn't really changed.
[9/8/23, 2:18:00 AM] Pascal: I went there was well. We took them on an outdoor excursion...that was a bit mad.
[9/9/23, 3:21:07 AM] Tom Hardiment: Talking of rugby...
Looking at the WhatsApp group we have enough from all four houses to put together a 7s competition if anyone's up for it.

Mullens fantasy team:
Fwds: Andy G (cptn) Pascal, Nick C, John V.
Backs: Me, Nick H, John V, Jonny R, Paul R.

Just saying
[9/9/23, 3:22:53 AM] Tom Hardiment: Sorry! Pls add Alex C  & AD
[9/9/23, 3:24:36 AM] Nick Carey: What, you mean like a _virtual_ game of 7’s yeah? Not an _actual_ game on an _actual_ pitch? 🤯
[9/9/23, 3:25:25 AM] Jon R: Plus 14 motability scooters..?
[9/9/23, 3:25:51 AM] Tom Hardiment: Actual game on Reed's 1st XV pitch if they'd agree. Could be tap.
[9/9/23, 3:26:11 AM] Nick Carey: (For context I’m currently weighing in at approx 22st and can just about make it all the way round Tesco’s without needing a rest! 🤣🤣🤣
[9/9/23, 3:26:18 AM] John Vocking: An a coach load of physios
[9/9/23, 3:27:15 AM] Nick Carey: I can _talk_ a good game still!
[9/9/23, 3:29:25 AM] Nick Carey: Plus, if Finchie let’s you have access to rest of chat before you joined, you will be able to see how much trauma I’m still carrying since the last time I played Bristowe at 7’s! 😢🥺😔 ‎<This message was edited>
[9/9/23, 3:34:12 AM] Tom Hardiment: Sorry to hear that Nick. Time to set it straight? 
Let's aim for March 2024.
6 months for us to get march fit
[9/9/23, 3:37:30 AM] Nick Carey: Hahaha! Hahahaha! Hahahaha! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 You are lovely Tom! I am afraid that, in my case at least, that ship had sailed! Although I would happily watch!
[9/9/23, 3:43:30 AM] Mark Finch: That’s about all I’ll be doing “marching” ! 😂
[9/9/23, 3:44:51 AM] Mark Finch: Sadly - it’s not a WhatApp feature to give all history to recent joiners !! That would have been perfect ! Apparently, you can do it for the previous 24 hours - but that’s it !
[9/9/23, 3:45:10 AM] Nick Carey: Bugger
[9/9/23, 3:46:59 AM] Barry Cawston: Mark might be a hassle but perhaps you could copy and paste a set of highlights like everyone’s intro post …
[9/9/23, 3:48:10 AM] Nick Carey: Just for Tom…

We were winning the final game against bristowe (I was skipper) and I jumped out of the line to try to nail Finchie… who obviously just skipped around me leaving me clutching thin air, my only contact being his studs in my face as he disappeared off to try line… leaving us the only sharing the 7s cup and me with a stud mark on my face to remind me for the next couple of weeks that it was all my fault - that’s true devastation Tim!!! 🤣
[9/9/23, 3:48:46 AM] Mark Finch: Great minds - I’m about 75% of the way through putting the  intros in a sharable doc. 
Once that’s done - the OCD in me feels like I need to take the best and funniest memories and put them in a doc for next year !!! 😀
[9/9/23, 3:49:09 AM] Barry Cawston: Ha ha 
V cool and thanks
[9/9/23, 3:49:31 AM] Barry Cawston: Got to love OCD
[9/9/23, 3:50:58 AM] David Edwards: 🤓
[9/9/23, 4:02:56 AM] Peter Milne: Maybe a walking version with drink breaks every minute! Good luck today to England. My dad was a proud kiwi so naturally, I have always supported the All Blacks. Having been at Twickenham to witness their biggest defeat ever, yesterday was their biggest defeat in the World Cup, biggest defeat to France and the first time they have lost a game in the group stage. Clearly favourites to lift the 🏆
[9/9/23, 4:12:58 AM] Paul Rushton: My last game of Rugby was 23rd ago , a Porter Drinkers game in Sussex. The sponge man was dressed in Black tie and administered large glasses of port to the players at regular drinks breaks through out the game.
[9/9/23, 4:13:27 AM] Paul Rushton: Possible format?
[9/9/23, 4:13:33 AM] Barry Cawston: Ok that changes everything I’m in
[9/9/23, 4:14:54 AM] Nick Carey: Where were you playing Paul? I used to play down in Sussex (for Hove) a very long time ago!
[9/9/23, 4:16:02 AM] Nick Carey: (Our vets team used to have glasses of port at half-time time instead of oranges… no black tie though sadly)
[9/9/23, 4:25:35 AM] Paul Rushton: I played at Pulborough on and off for a few years
[9/9/23, 4:27:58 AM] Nick Carey: Ah! Had some ding-dong scraps with them at Brighton Poly but didn’t play them very often at Hove for some reason…
[9/9/23, 4:28:50 AM] Barry Cawston: I created a rugby team at Leeds uni back in the day called The Rhinos at half time we ‘shot-gunned’ a can of lager … and try scorers were awarded a bottle of tequila … could have been expensive but although we had a few outstanding players we could only ever muster 12-13 players so only had to buy one bottle all season
[9/9/23, 4:29:50 AM] Barry Cawston: Oh and we obviously never won a game … all the other teams hated us which was fun
[9/9/23, 4:40:52 AM] David Edwards: Why is this news no surprise!! 😂
[9/9/23, 4:42:37 AM] James Eason: @447917428535 will the Reedsunion be at School? I presume so; mention that as I think that they usually have a cricket match that day too? We could muscle in on that?
[9/9/23, 4:49:28 AM] Mark Finch: I think we should do something on Saturday 29th at a pub (pubs) separately, and the official one is Sun 30th. Shiella @447834766704 can tell you about the cricket - I thinks it’s normally the Dylan Paris memorial match which I think is the Sunday ! ‎<This message was edited>
[9/9/23, 4:54:06 AM] James Eason: Ah yes the Dylan Paris match. I like the idea of a massive p*ss-up on the Saturday night; means we can all pitch up on the Sunday hungover, sweaty and disoriented. We should also have a sweepstake on the first person to have a set-to with one of the masters…
[9/9/23, 4:59:40 AM] Jon R: And how many minutes in before a set to with one of the masters. If GM is still about I’m putting money on myself…
[9/9/23, 5:41:10 AM] Roger Attwell: I’m not sure I’m allowed back on school grounds, Just something Tyson said to me the day I left……….
[9/9/23, 5:43:15 AM] John Vocking: Last time i saw GM he reminded me of cross between leslie phillips and Terry Thomas😳
[9/9/23, 5:45:13 AM] Jon R: 😂😂😂 that 70’s porn actor tache
[9/9/23, 5:58:51 AM] Andrew Shiells: Maybe Finchy should try and get another table for our old perverts sorry teachers!!
[9/9/23, 6:55:25 AM] Mike Nunan: Mark I've just done a little experiment using WhatsApp Web, to see what can be done to capture full history, it's a bit primitive but it is possible
[9/9/23, 6:57:23 AM] Mike Nunan: you have to do a ton of manual scrolling to get the full history to show up in the browser, then you can shift-click to select the whole lot and copy it as text - emojis are preserved and you get message timestamps and phone numbers (names only if you have that person as a saved phone contact)
[9/9/23, 6:57:31 AM] Mike Nunan: small sample as pasted into Word:
‎[9/9/23, 6:57:37 AM] Mike Nunan: ‎<attached: 00000841-PHOTO-2023-09-09-06-57-37.jpg>
[9/9/23, 6:58:19 AM] Mike Nunan: could archive the history now or perhaps better still at some point once we have 100% membership here, but the lack of images would be a shame
[9/9/23, 7:05:01 AM] Mike Nunan: oh actually you can do the same thing without the scrolling directly on the phone, there an export chat feature that can send an email of the exact same text as you get that way, optionally with media attachments - still not inline though
[9/9/23, 7:59:23 AM] Roger Attwell: Finchie, who is in charge of IT here? Maybe Peter Potts should be appointed?
[9/9/23, 8:14:12 AM] Jo Chan: Cambridge certified.

[9/9/23, 9:31:16 AM] Andrew Shiells: She looks ginger Roger is that a preference 😜
[9/9/23, 9:34:12 AM] Roger Attwell: Piss off! No ginger left in my life! That all went away 30 years ago!

[9/9/23, 9:37:30 AM] Dave Wilko: Hello Roger👍
[9/9/23, 9:40:43 AM] Roger Attwell: Hi Dave, the ginger comments refer to a classic school picture that I posted early in this thread.

That aside how is life with you?
[9/9/23, 9:42:06 AM] Peter Milne: You haven't changed a bit Roger!🤣
[9/9/23, 9:42:32 AM] Dave Wilko: I know I’ve been following it all… very nostalgic 
Yes all good mate
I’m sitting flicking between the football and rugby and then I thought I recognise that face😂
[9/9/23, 9:43:15 AM] Roger Attwell: I’ll take that as a compliment!
[9/9/23, 9:44:36 AM] Peter Milne: We should try and post more of these before and after photos.
[9/9/23, 9:45:41 AM] Roger Attwell: I’m flicking between rugby and cricket, never got into football, nor American football, still can’t get my head around “time outs”
[9/9/23, 10:06:24 AM] James Eason: Looking good Roger, takes me back to those Saturday morning discos in Woking, fags, ELO, and skateboards.
[9/9/23, 10:07:39 AM] Roger Attwell: James I wasn’t bald then!!!
[9/9/23, 10:08:18 AM] Roger Attwell: Sorry,Jez forgot that one!
[9/9/23, 10:17:56 AM] Dave Wilko: God I remember them🙈🙈

[9/9/23, 11:16:37 AM] Andrew Shiells: Is that a red tulip?
[9/9/23, 11:35:10 AM] Peter Potts: Mike's got it right, no sugarcoating it. When it comes to extracting something fancy from WhatsApp, all you get is a text dump and an image gallery. But I may be able to do something.
[9/9/23, 11:37:49 AM] William Pendered: That's 2
[9/9/23, 11:53:50 AM] Roger Attwell: Funny you mention Woking, it’s part of my life, when getting my first tattoo at the age of 16 I decided to have a tattoo around my belly button that said Made In Middlesbrough , I was actually born in Middlesbrough, it hurt that much after “Made In” I told the tattoo guy “Woking” will do!

[9/9/23, 7:10:07 PM] Roger Attwell: Thanks Peter, I knew when I cheekily suggested you earlier as Head of IT that you would sort it out!!
[9/9/23, 7:16:54 PM] Peter Potts: Flattery works. You must be a manager.

[9/9/23, 7:30:58 PM] Peter Potts: I came to the US in 2012 too. What a coincidence? I've been in California the whole time. Where are you?
[9/9/23, 7:31:53 PM] Peter Potts: Before that I was in Canada for 7 years.

[9/9/23, 7:40:21 PM] Roger Attwell: You must have all those pictures saved and then threw them out in one go!

[9/9/23, 7:45:46 PM] Peter Potts: I did. I scanned all my prints and negatives sometime before they deteriorated more than they already had.
Mine is a long story too. It's surprisingly hard to immigrate... twice...
[9/9/23, 7:48:08 PM] Peter Potts: I've recently been teaching my daughter the joys of hospital corners. She's decided to go for the American style of sheet under comforter rather than just a European-style duvet.
[9/9/23, 8:00:23 PM] Roger Attwell: That picture isn’t pretty! Can’t believe we actually lived like that!
[9/9/23, 8:03:27 PM] Peter Potts: Yes. I don't remember it being so grim, but photos don't lie. Mind you, we probably would have destroyed anything more fancy. I can visualize us lighting fireworks from the windows and tunnel of death pillow fights.
[9/9/23, 8:07:28 PM] Roger Attwell: Daughters don’t listen! When my daughter said she was off to Uni to study geography I asked what she planned on doing with that degree, her answer, I’m going to be a weather girl on the BBC !
[9/9/23, 8:11:42 PM] Roger Attwell: She left with her degree and went on to DHL on their graduate course, got her Masters while getting paid and hasn’t ever been on TV
[9/9/23, 8:13:13 PM] Roger Attwell: Unlike me she actually took advantage of her education opportunities!!!
[9/9/23, 8:18:15 PM] Roger Attwell: “The tunnel of death!” You couldn’t explain how bad that could be!
[9/9/23, 11:09:36 PM] Giles Solomon: I remember being “crucified“ in the dorm! Think there was someone else next to me. It was like the scene out of Life of Brian but not easy to look on the bright side of life 🤣.
[9/9/23, 11:31:04 PM] Mark Finch: This is funny to wake up to. Yesterdays slice of time…Most of us watching the England Vs Argentina battle (RWC) but back then it was the invasion in 1981, while Roger the Dodger encourages other people to do stuff (on this rare occasion it was good stuff) and Pottsy and Mike Nunan get techie. Plus Dave Edwards befriends random strangers and invites old friends back to his place. Meanwhile Duncan still has that smile, Jez talks cricket, Shiellsy takes the piss, Bazza and Finchie are the ideas men (waiting for others to deliver), Jonny still hates Geoff, Pete Milne is the sensible one. Nick still bitter about sharing the 7s trophy….
….So nothing has actually changed in 40 years !!! ‎<This message was edited>
[9/9/23, 11:32:00 PM] Mark Finch: Great work on both ChatGPT and the photos Pottsy  ! @16504609902
[9/9/23, 11:54:26 PM] Barry Cawston: Hilarious… love it all
[9/10/23, 12:15:01 AM] Mark Finch: While I’m lying in bed and in storytelling mode, a couple of funny stories as I was tracking people down….

Joe Chan, convinced that I was some kind of stalking axe murder said “prove to me you are from Reeds and know me”. That was simple. One sentence and a word. The word was “Bristowe” and the sentence “I make you happy ?”. For all those not in the Close or Bristowe, that was what Joe would say if he thought you were down or unhappy. Not in a Thai Massage kind of way, I hasten to add ! Just humour.
[9/10/23, 12:17:03 AM] Mark Finch: And for all those in Capel, I have not taken this as personal rejection, but we should take it as collective rejection. When contacting Phil Umney about the reunion all I got back was “have fun”. I take that as a “no” then. 😂😂😂
[9/10/23, 2:21:14 AM] James Eason: (Slightly serious and deep bit coming, soz) In many ways, I understand what Phil Umney’s thoughts might be; he and I spent quite some time together in the run-up to leaving and afterwards, and there was quite a lot of disenchantment, and largely it was down to some of the Masters’ attitude and behaviour to certain pupils. Reed’s did have a bit of a habit of being a place where it’s useful if your face fits. The threads and chats on this group are ‘squaring’ a few circles as they say. (I am not bitter) There are some folk on here that I spent many great formative years with and with whom I have quite an emotional attachment. Yes, this is a little deep for a Sunday morning, however, some of the folk on here I have known since we were three. Personally I feel a slight sense of imposter syndrome for this as I guess I had put SO much of it to the back of my mind striving to move on and achieve a worthwhile career - despite the masters not having ‘Fide’ in me. I was however at the school for 7 years - have I blanked SO much out? A few random memories: prep school at Moleside with SPM, Dave E, Peter M; meeting Andy Glass and Garf Hatton on an MCC cricket tour to Holland with Scaitcliffe School and Mike Gosling before we had even started at Reed’s! Apologies, but this is helpful for me.
[9/10/23, 2:30:36 AM] Jon R: Shame not to see Phil, I had a tough time when I got to Reeds having just lost my dad and been uprooted, though he might not know it he helped me out through a really difficult couple of years ‎<This message was edited>
[9/10/23, 2:41:17 AM] Barry Cawston: Phil was a big part of my first years at Reed’s … great guy … he introduced me too AC/DC & black sabbath which helped cure me from the unlikely truth that I got the highest RE common entrance mark in the history of Reed’s and was certainly a Chalis candidate for the priesthood 

All I can say is Thank God
[9/10/23, 2:46:13 AM] Barry Cawston: James I totally get your sentiment, for me I wanted to clear my DNA of many of the trappings of Public school … 7 years in Leeds at the uni and poly certainly balanced that and it was great to share some of those years with @447889646381  and Kieran and I am sure that Chris Brogden loved his time north too
[9/10/23, 3:08:49 AM] Steve Gates: Did you go to Leeds straight from Reeds - I was there for 3 years doing  my degree in Geography and Management studies. Met my (long-suffering) wife at Leeds Poly Disco…. 😂😂😂
[9/10/23, 3:31:55 AM] Barry Cawston: Leeds poly disco was something else 

Now I was working and travelling in the states and Canada for two years before going north but I’ve got a vague memory that we did cross paths in Leeds ??
[9/10/23, 3:55:16 AM] Andrew Marsh: As there is something of a Yorkshire theme to the current posts - I thought I would chip in. I have not really thought about Reeds for a very long time - however my wife has thought I am loosing it as I have chuckled away to myself reading the posts. On reflection I have fond  memories of Reeds, academic education may not have been the best, however I think the overall experience was great and likely could not be repeated in todays more regulated / grade focussed world. After leaving Reeds - I started working at Lloyd’s of London (where I met James Eason, lounging nonchalantly against a syndicate box) after 3 years or so realised it was more like a club than work, so went into the money markets. Notwithstanding waving my arms around and shouting a lot - I not sure if I bought or sold very much at all and in need of a more normal life I moved to Yorkshire. Stumbled into banking - which will come as great amusement to anybody who shared a maths lesson with me. (Trick is to employ people much cleverer than you and delegate) I now live with my long suffering wife Ingrid (married 27 years) together with her horses and cats in rural Derbyshire. After nearly 30 years in the corporate bank, I am beginning to think about retirement - more travel etc Does not feel like I have been as busy over the past 40 years as many of you. Nick still remember the trip to Spain really well - Barry going to see Elton John - now I think about it - too many memories to write down.
[9/10/23, 3:59:05 AM] Barry Cawston: Hi andy 
Nice to hear from you ! 
You visited us in Leeds a couple of times 🕺🏻
And yes The Elton John concert was a classic teenage night if I recall
[9/10/23, 4:01:58 AM] Andrew Marsh: Hi Barry - remember visiting you in Leeds  (or more to the point my liver does) Trip to Bournemouth and passing out at a party - your parents very kind hospitality - lots of memories
[9/10/23, 4:02:11 AM] Barry Cawston: ‎This message was deleted.
[9/10/23, 4:04:27 AM] Barry Cawston: Now who came with me to serenade the Claremont girls carrying a ladder through Esher to climb up to the 2nd floor balcony of  ??? Home (Rebecca?)  … seem to remember chris and @447952310564 and Greg Anderson being there but probably 5-6 people 

We sang an Elton John song then too … pleased Leeds helped shift my music tastes  🙏
[9/10/23, 4:06:52 AM] Andrew Marsh: I remember that - completely forgotten until just now- embarrassed to say still listen to Elton John in the car - some of us never grow up
[9/10/23, 4:08:30 AM] Barry Cawston: Ha ha 
He has his place …. But Chris De Burgh has excited my record collection
[9/10/23, 4:09:42 AM] Andrew Marsh: That’s somebody else I still listen to - embarrassed from Derbyshire
[9/10/23, 4:12:12 AM] Tom Hardiment: Remember it well Barry. I was helping you serenade by playing my trumpet whilst half way up a ladder. Surreal.
[9/10/23, 4:13:26 AM] Barry Cawston: Oh no 
Too much information!!!

I may well have to assume some responsibility for that 

Please check out Manu Choa as a Detox
[9/10/23, 4:14:05 AM] Barry Cawston: @447952310564 
Well it kinda worked ❤️💃❤️
[9/10/23, 4:16:48 AM] Andrew Marsh: Looks like MC sings in 7 languages - how am I going to sing along ?
[9/10/23, 4:17:47 AM] Tom Hardiment: Hi Andy. Thanks for the update. 
I remember a cracking party at your house (near Lingfield?), and a particular girl. (Mandy I think?).
[9/10/23, 4:19:29 AM] Andrew Marsh: Hi Tom - good to hear from you - I can remember Mandy, but not the party (which is slightly worrying)
[9/10/23, 4:20:59 AM] Chris: Ha! Funny ... I think it was Rebecca ... I think the bigger question is why on earth we were doing it in the first place?!
[9/10/23, 4:21:22 AM] Chris: But also makes me think of Caron of course
[9/10/23, 4:22:25 AM] Nick Carey: Talking of music tastes, you particularly enjoyed the Thompson Twins on that holiday if I remember correctly! 😉
Also I remember trying to impress the girls at a restaurant and ordering steak tartare- it was steak, what could go wrong! - and having to pretend I always knew I had ordered a plate of raw meat and raw egg! (Glad I did, it was delicious!) 🤣🤣🤣
[9/10/23, 4:25:47 AM] Tom Hardiment: It was summer term. In the garden. Hay bales. Whole load of us came. We slept in the sitting room. The girls in the loft of the barn? Your mum patrolled to keep us from roaming.
Anything coming back? 😂
[9/10/23, 4:25:57 AM] Andrew Marsh: Cracking holiday - Guadalmina Alta - back seat of the coach to Spain drinking Pernod - your Grandfather was a fantastic character - champagne on our cornflakes (not something I have repeated)
[9/10/23, 4:27:35 AM] Andrew Marsh: Hi Tom - that’s what 40 years does - somethings you remember with absolute clarity and some things not at all - shame, sounds like I have forgotten a great party.
[9/10/23, 4:34:29 AM] Nick Carey: I do remember a party in effingham near the cricket club (maybe your then girl friend’s Finchie?) -stands out in my mind for 2 reasons… the first because, although I was never very successful with girls (see earlier comment on me being the embodiment of “anti-cool 😁), I did get off with a bird there! 
The other reason being being I am pretty sure she is the one who gifted me a life time of cold sores! 😭
[9/10/23, 4:35:40 AM] Nick Carey: That rings a bell now! Can’t remember if I was there or just remember the stories!
[9/10/23, 4:37:46 AM] Tom Hardiment: Indeed. I think it was more that I remember Mandy. She was showing off to us by doing the splits. 
This forum has helped being back burried memories generally: Geoff Martin's tasch; Saturday morning lessons; carrying Barry's ladder through Esher; Jim Challis' teabags hanging out to dry; and trying to get 60 kids to sing Libiamo
[9/10/23, 4:38:15 AM] Jon R: That’s an image that shouldn’t be shared Nick…and one that is now going to be difficult to shake 😆
[9/10/23, 4:42:17 AM] Barry Cawston: The one and only Sarah Gardener … three classic parties 
If I’m correct two as my girlfriend and then one as Marks . ..one fancy dress 
@447889646381 came with me by the local train dressed as an amateur boxer with a black eye …. 

Pictures please somebody
[9/10/23, 4:43:54 AM] Nick Carey: Thank you Barry!
[9/10/23, 4:52:58 AM] Andrew Marsh: I do remember one fantastic party at Sarah’s - shame the smart phone was not invented earlier so we all had photos to share -
[9/10/23, 5:02:04 AM] Jon R: @447771308270 I have one hazy memory of you being locked in a car boot (at Claremont?) with a young female…details obscured and hoping someone can fill in the blanks? Or is my memory letting me down again
[9/10/23, 5:04:52 AM] Andrew Marsh: Hiya - not sure that was me - hope I would have remembered if it was me
[9/10/23, 5:11:24 AM] Nick Carey: Sudden flash memory of me, Pix & Bill pulling 3 girls under the pagoda at Kew on a biology field trip! 
Bill went out with his for quite a while, not sure about you Pix? Embarrassed to say I can’t remember the name of the girl I paired up with (Maria?) but we petered out quickly (I was painfully shy) and she ended up with AD - although that got complicated shortly thereafter, but not my story to tell.
[9/10/23, 5:14:15 AM] Andrew Marsh: Ah - yes - there is complicated and then there is really complicated. Nick remember visiting you in Brighton - rugby - too much to drink - something about claiming on the insurance for a TV !
[9/10/23, 5:17:31 AM] Nick Carey: OMG yes! It worked too! Got a new TV for one that had just died a stately death! 
One thing the BPRFC boys could do was drink! Top times!
[9/10/23, 5:20:32 AM] Nick Carey: AD, before you got into banking, did you briefly dabble in telecoms/messaging at all?
[9/10/23, 5:25:07 AM] Andrew Marsh: Hi Nick - not me
[9/10/23, 5:27:17 AM] Andrew Marsh: Can’t say that I have seen ‘stately death’ as a reason on a claim before. Alternatively- I hit it with a golf club m’lord
[9/10/23, 5:28:01 AM] Zaid Tuaima: Hi everyone. I only remember 3 discos, one at Notre Dam and two at Claremont. I also remember (at least I think I do) Adam Pensotti and an accomplice doing an SAS routine and making their entrance through the roof?? or am I suffering from memory loss like some of the others on this chat?
[9/10/23, 5:31:35 AM] Andrew Marsh: That sounds like something Andy Glass would do

[9/10/23, 5:37:52 AM] Nick Carey: The stately death came first, then I dropped on concrete stairs whilst moving it to a new flat (or hit it with a golf club!) - tv screens are surprisingly hard to break!
[9/10/23, 5:41:07 AM] Nick Carey: I do remember someone snogging a girl at the Notre Dam disco and being conjoined by a stream of spittle as they separated…
[9/10/23, 5:42:20 AM] Nick Carey: Never mind - almost crossed paths with an Andrew Marsh, always wandered… no need! 🤣
[9/10/23, 5:46:02 AM] Nick Carey: We had a disco at Reed’s in 6-2… I remember it because it was the only other time I got a snog that year! 🤣 Phillippa Toulson! Wow, that name came out of nowhere!
[9/10/23, 7:10:57 AM] Andrew Marsh: Hi James - wow where did you dig that photo up from - mad party when the 1958 building closed - breakfast in the Captains Room - lunch at Simpson - drinks in the afternoon in the Marine Club - drinks after work in the Lamb. Did we actually do any work at all ?
[9/10/23, 7:15:07 AM] James Eason: Oddly, it’s on the Internet, and yes, we had that massive party closing the old Lloyd’s room when I hit the Lutine bell with a direct hit with one of the box cushions, we then got completely off our faces in the pub and I went to the dentist that afternoon as a sweaty dribbling heap. And to answer your question, no, we didn’t do any work at all; that’s why we left to actually do something constructive! ‎<This message was edited>
[9/10/23, 7:21:07 AM] Andrew Marsh: That’s pretty much as I remember it - some party - throwing syndicate paperwork off the balconies  by the drawer full - forgot about the Lutine bell (shameful behaviour) how we didn’t get into serious trouble I don’t know.
[9/10/23, 7:24:54 AM] Jon R: Oh no been doing you a disservice all these years…I’ve been remembering you as Sid ‘smell my finger’ Marsh 🙃
[9/10/23, 7:25:29 AM] Andrew Marsh: That must be another Sid
[9/10/23, 7:57:31 AM] Pascal: I remember the Elton John concert at Hammersmith
[9/10/23, 7:58:39 AM] Mark Finch: Jesus Christ. You pop out for a cycle and few beers, return, and the chat has exploded !

Love it.

Thanks for opening up Jez. Important and accurate stuff there. It’s interesting - so many different experiences through the same era. Do I rename the group “the ‘84 self-help group ?”. It’s good to talk.

I’ll open up a bit later (!!) but just to build on some great stuff that has surfaced today …

Sarah Gardner’s parties. Spot on Baz. Legendary ! That first one was just incredible - I think Shiellsy met Tessa (I’ll let him update you). But I do know a few of you used to do the hay bailing on Tessa’s folks farm !
I would hazard a guess, Mandy was Amanda Ferguson ? American ? ! She could “flick flack” for England and Uber flexible !! :-) She was my “one that got away” as I went out with her for a while - but was way out of my comfort zone (and league) after a Sunday Tea at a very fancy London hotel meeting her parents learning they ran diamond mines in Africa. Oh how life could be different now !!! 
I reckon there was probably a second party at the Gardeners before I tag teamed with Barry ;-) 
I can’t let Chris’ comment about Caron go without an update - as she was legendary and Glasses OH for a long while - just to let many folk here (who would probably not know) she sadly passed away a couple of years ago in Thailand 🥲
Caron was great mates with Sarah and Rebecca and the Nortre Dame / Claremont girls, so while not involved in laddergate - certainly remember it. We have to track down Greg Anderson as he may have dated Rebecca ? 
I do remember the Notre Dame parties and I’m sure Glassey tried it on with a nun ? (He certainly did with the Claremont PE teacher). 
One disco involved a Claremont or Notre Dame fight Vs Reeds - for some strange reason Lucius Peart and myself were put up for Reeds. Poor chaps !!! :-)

Zaid - you are spot on about Pensotti’s entrance !! 

Nick and Maria ! Oh what could have been ! 
Nick - was it the Thompson Twins ? As I have a recollection of a rugby tour to Lyme Regis and spending a whole day listening to Alf (one of the Thomson Twins ?) on my Sony Walkman, while looking out to sea wondering why I had no recollection of the night before (apparently I was found under a bush asleep at 3am) !!! 

Happy days !
[9/10/23, 8:55:53 AM] John Vocking: That was Uilliam Littleboy boasting after having seen his girlfriend 🤮
[9/10/23, 8:59:39 AM] John Vocking: He was jabbing that bloody (not literally … well I don’t think so 😳) finger under the nose of anyone passing within 10 feet. Don’t think he washed his hand for a week. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/10/23, 9:54:58 AM] Mark Finch: Cancel that. It was Anne Ferguson ! Not Amanda !! 😂
[9/10/23, 10:09:39 AM] Roger Attwell: That’s always a fine moment in every young man’s life! All your friends asking did you put the finger up there!
[9/10/23, 10:17:10 AM] Graham Hales: So here's my round-up ... and apologies, it's taken a bit of time.
First up it's great to see that you guys has such a good time in 6th form and embryonic friendships clearly deepened.
I took a different path and bailed out post O-levels. Not really sure what drove that, but I do remember a conversation with @447896340167 where I was telling him the benefits of staying for 6th form and he was telling me why it was time to go. I don't know if it was that conversation or my general sense of teenage apathy, but either way I felt I needed a change of scene and a different journey from the one my brothers had so effortlessly thrived in, so off I went.
I ended up at a local tech college and saw a very different side of life and then went on to do Business Studies. taking the heavy drinking option and it seems some of you took that course too! Realising I needed income, I went into advertising for around 10 years which enabled me to combine the drinking with something called work, which was all great fun. I then evolved into brand consulting and ended up as CEO of a company called Interbrand which took me all over the world and provided some great adventures. That all ended about 7 years ago and since then I've been doing some consultancy on my own, taken a few full time roles including time as CEO of a start-up consultancy, big fish, and I now work sporadically as a consultant, coach and volunteer a bit with the Samaritans. Along the way I was married for 20 years. That imploded spectacularly but I've not once regretted that ending! We had x3 kids, Violet 19, Sam 17 and Tilly 15 and I've now been with my new partner, MIchele, for the last 5 years. @447952310564 came by a few years ago which was great fun and brought back many happy memories. Anyway, in the spirit of Churchill wanting to write a short letter, but not having the time, I'll end it there. Delighted to see you're all doing so well from the notes unlocked by @16504609902. The pics are brilliant, maybe a few signs of lives well lived! Onwards!
[9/10/23, 10:24:08 AM] Nick Carey: Memories you you, me and Dave Edwards in the U14b front row, Graham - with Dave dangling his feet into the opposition 2nd row to try and steal their ball (absolute nutter!)

[9/10/23, 10:56:42 AM] John Vocking: Punching 🤣
[9/10/23, 11:14:29 AM] David Edwards: Haha…that was some front row, especially when Ullian Littleboy joined in as well!! 🤠
[9/10/23, 11:16:10 AM] David Edwards: Good to hear from you Graham! I seem to remember you were a very strong breaststroke swimmer…is that correct?
[9/10/23, 11:17:27 AM] Graham Hales: Weirdly I think I was at the time, but you wouldn’t guess it these days. More of a passive wallow now
[9/10/23, 11:18:17 AM] William Pendered: It's very vague, but recall something Nick, we grabbed any chance those days. I'm Like AD, not sure why 🤔

[9/10/23, 12:13:28 PM] Graham Hales: @14168040878 we did used to have one of those - my daughter loved the pic and demanded I forwarded it to her … no problems there then!
[9/10/23, 12:14:55 PM] Jo Chan: I’m not sure why I always have a camera then to catch some teenage crime evidence.
[9/10/23, 12:51:48 PM] Barry Cawston: As I have said before 
This whole thing is fantastic

But I am a bit wary of ‘old’ language and stories with regards some of the female sex  … totally get it but hope we can be respectful on this one moving forward …. Just a bit of heads up from cider country as I’m not only an artist but my life has made me a both something of a radical and woke and proud of that. 

The stories are memories I am enjoying reliving but the ‘history’ we share is certainly a complicated one but I am beginning to feel that this reborn communication is going to be an inspiring one … 



🕺🏻
[9/10/23, 12:55:22 PM] Barry Cawston: Oh and while I write this the Welsh are losing which is to be celebrated 😁😁😁

[9/10/23, 1:02:56 PM] Peter Milne: I agree @447946207411 . It is amazing to be connected to people that have been a part of life at Reeds. It is strange because it was such a long time ago and, to be honest, mixed memories. The negative stuff shut out for decades. 40 years on, all good and thanks again @447917428535 for what has been an amazing conversation.
[9/10/23, 1:18:11 PM] Barry Cawston: Wales ahead
 oh well 
I was named barry john after the great fly half and I met him when I was 12 

I asked for his signature and he asked my name  and he laughed and turned to my friend and said
I suppose your name is Gareth Edwards
[9/10/23, 1:21:40 PM] James Eason: Hi Barry, I understand your viewpoint, but I am disinclined to erase the history; what we did, right or wrong, is part of the foundation of the formation of the persons in this group.  Yes, we did what we did but it was standard practice in a different era.  I understand that many persons want to take a new (woke) era forward but that can’t be at a cost of learning from happened previously.  
I would be happy to see a separate WhatsApp group set up where there is NO such discussion of the all manner of perverse and maladjusted things that occurred, but I am still in favour of the option to have a channel to discuss matters openly and with impunity as this is the enduring and binding material that made us who we are and what we are in a different era.
I have previously expressed certain dissatisfaction as to how masters etc. behaved, and I can’t see a reason to eradicate the contents of a discussion just because forty years on we are trying to change the way persons operate - again, even with the best intention.
If we were to have dear Kevin Boland in the room we might all f*cking well hear and learn a thing; I for one am not happy to censor thoughts and opinions in a private group.  This is great therapy, learning, closure, and we all have a common valency of bond that was forged in different times.
[9/10/23, 1:24:53 PM] Roger Attwell: Gentlemen I’m out.
[9/10/23, 1:30:27 PM] Barry Cawston: Ha ha 
Hi james
Oh it’s getting interesting 
I don’t want to eradicate anything but great stories from the past have so far been expressed amazingly honestly and I love it but it would be very simple for us to have an easy laugh using the language of that day which isn’t I would think any of our language now 

Really don’t want this to be a big thing or stop the crack but thought I would just make a nod early on 

PS Rog 
Don’t go
[9/10/23, 1:31:42 PM] Barry Cawston: Hi Rog 

it’s been great to hear from you let’s keep the communication going and see where it ends 

It’s been cool so far
[9/10/23, 1:35:49 PM] James Eason: Hi Barry, there’s bound to be a range of views on what is acceptable in this regard, I personally don’t tend to get phased by much. Through my work I have seen the evil that man can do.  If a different form of language needs to be used to relive these tales, then fair enough, but they still exist.
[9/10/23, 1:43:20 PM] Barry Cawston: Hi James 
I have and will tell some stories in to this group that are let’s just say ‘extraordinary’ which I would never edit indeed I told my daughter and her friend who are 17 a few last night and they were wonderfully shocked and it was great and I loved sharing it with them and actually would share everything and do. 

But my point is the past and the present 

and I am trying to allow the movement into now so that we are not caught up in a  pool of nostalgia
[9/10/23, 1:45:11 PM] Peter Potts: Clearly, after 40 years, the zeitgeist of society has undergone a significant transformation. So, there are moments from the past that are frankly embarrassing. Nevertheless, these are part of our history, and it is what it is. However, there's no need to glorify the cringe.
[9/10/23, 1:50:11 PM] Peter Milne: This is a big group of Old Reedonians that Finchie has put together, and our stories and experiences over the last 40 years have been so diverse. Some have kept in touch since those days. Some have been away from the Reeds connection for an awful long time. We all have our thoughts about those days. In the end, I guess it is an opportunity to share our lives after a bloody long time, respect our differences, and respect that we are where we are at 57/58 years of age.
[9/10/23, 2:09:41 PM] John Vocking: Nothing wrong with nostalgia. But there are things that were done and language used that we all know is not acceptable today. But it happened and in most cases is cringeworthy and embarrassing. 40 years prior to our time at Reed’s I’m sure it was even worse. 

There will be those at Reeds now that will face the same in 40 years. Times and language seemed acceptable now will be judged differently in the future.
[9/10/23, 2:19:16 PM] James Eason: Yes, and I very much understand why persons embrace that which is as  and as Barry refers to as ‘woke’. (Not my bag, but then I’ve always been a bit of a Nazi, apparently) Personally, I don’t get bothered by any language, but if some do and the group should adapt then so be it - let’s keep things happy.
[9/10/23, 2:26:15 PM] Andrew Shiells: I’ve always called a spade a spade see hopefully many of you next year! 😜
[9/11/23, 12:21:36 AM] David Edwards: Haha…there are so many stories, I starting to dream about various times and people during this time 😵‍💫…..

One of my fondest memories was the ice shoot that was created between The Close and Main school. It started off with a few of us getting there early on those properly cold and icy mornings when one could hardly feel their feet and skidding down the hill. The grounds man got involved and agreed to get the hose and pour gallons of water down the strip to create the water shoot. It quickly became early morning carnage with multi runs of us sliding at ridiculous speeds down the ice creating jumps and obstacles to make the runs harder and more dangerous. Until someone smashed there head flipping backwards on the ice…was it all over..hell no. It was agreed we would roll the scarfs on our heads to make crash helmets so we could carry on!!! Still makes me smile every time I think back at it!  😁 ‎<This message was edited>
[9/11/23, 12:41:36 AM] James Eason: Yup! And we had a ‘Blakeys’ check to be sure our shoes didn’t damage the smooth and shiny piste-of-death.
[9/11/23, 1:35:11 AM] David Edwards: Haha…how could I forget the ‘Blakey’s’ that enabled us to go down the shoot at      Mach 1 speed 😂
[9/11/23, 11:25:54 AM] Graham Hales: Anyone remember 'gozzing'. Maybe one for those of us that joined at The Close. Second years used to leave Saturday evening films early, ambush us and push us into gorse bushes. I remember one guy literally being swung by his arms and ankles over the bank by the all weather hockey pitch. 
I still can't walk past a gorse bush without checking for an ambush ... possible PTSD. 
Barbaric times; I'd like to say character forming, but barbaric is more accurate
[9/11/23, 11:28:34 AM] Peter Milne: Definitely. I live in the New Forest and I am surrounded by gorse bushes and I still remember......😟
[9/11/23, 11:28:55 AM] Mark Finch: I still leak ! 😂
[9/11/23, 11:31:11 AM] Jo Chan: Omg. Yessssss. The boarding schools does taught me one thing. Avoid those ambush guys as much as poss. Learn how to run fast. 🏃
[9/11/23, 11:31:51 AM] James Eason: I only think of the potential to be gozzed when I walk past one these days.
[9/11/23, 11:32:05 AM] Jo Chan: It’s all fun n game now but at the time it stinks. No pun intended.
[9/11/23, 11:34:38 AM] Graham Hales: If only the films had been better and the second years had wanted to stay till the end!
[9/11/23, 11:35:48 AM] James Eason: I remember The Pink Panther on the TV in the Close after games on a Saturday.
[9/11/23, 11:35:58 AM] Jo Chan: After film ambush is way more entertaining than watching the eagle has landed.
[9/11/23, 11:36:25 AM] Jo Chan: For the senior while we were the junior.
[9/11/23, 11:37:54 AM] Graham Hales: It maybe that you were distracted from the film by the imminent threat of a gozzing

[9/11/23, 11:51:53 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: It’s a winners shirt!
[9/11/23, 11:52:29 AM] Mark Finch: Ah ha ! Lacking France ?!
[9/11/23, 11:54:18 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: Or Ireland!

It’s all the previous holders
[9/12/23, 12:01:59 AM] Andrew Shiells: Look like the cup holders a neutral though so anyone’s title!! 😜
[9/12/23, 12:47:16 AM] Steve Gates: Absolutely - never run so fast in my life…. And for years afterwards I alway though that they were “goz” bushes and not “gorse”…. 😂😂😂

[9/12/23, 8:15:47 AM] Peter Potts: Wow. Looks like it was taken 100 years ago. What was going on there?
[9/12/23, 8:16:45 AM] James Eason: Yes, if every picture tells a story, than this one is rather oblique.
[9/12/23, 10:07:14 AM] Pascal: Have a memory of that and the blakeys. And as for the gorsing that was true boarding school stuff. As for punishments from 6th formers I remember : ordered to stand in the corrdiro and stare at the clock for hours, writing 6 pagès or so (title: the inside of a ping pong ball) every word an alternate colour and 20 words/line, having to change into rugby clothes and then run down to be outside the their window, stand for however long, then rush back in and change into whatever other clothes they told us for however long they said, beds overturned, I'm sure there are others.
[9/12/23, 10:15:03 AM] Pascal: I'd had enough of the school by 16. Being a boarder just made it worse. I just wanted to leave and get as far away as possible from it. However, it was 7 years of my life and during the last 2 years I still had memorable times even if it seemed like I was in a surreal prison experiment.
[9/12/23, 10:15:35 AM] Pascal: Anyone contacted Sean Gough BTW?
[9/12/23, 10:18:42 AM] Mark Finch: No reply from him on LinkedIn - so if you have a way ?
[9/12/23, 10:37:11 AM] James Eason: Do you remember the first week of the first form in the close and Peggy asked Gough, where he had been when he turned up late, and he said “oh, I thought it was still ‘playtime”.  Didn’t that become his nickname?
[9/12/23, 10:48:46 AM] Graham Hales: I remember being grabbed by the ankles by some prefect, who then ran down x4 flights of stairs with my arse banging against every stair. God knows how we survived or what those sadistic minds went onto to achieve? Tory MP’s perhaps!
[9/12/23, 11:46:19 AM] Nick Carey: My personal tormentor was Ian Organ… I was never really sure how to feel about what happened to him - conflicted 🤷‍♂️
[9/12/23, 11:47:24 AM] Graham Hales: I don’t remember that one. What was his party trick?
[9/12/23, 11:51:14 AM] Nick Carey: Oh, nothing compared to some, psychological sadism mostly, just knew how to make me feel really shit. 
Died in a bike accident (I think), possibly even before the end of my first year (3rd yr, his 6-2) - not 100% on the details
[9/12/23, 12:28:13 PM] Malcolm: Regretfully the  Public School system used to be flawed, 3rd years being bullied by 6th formers and then the whole cycle starts again, "I was bullied so I will bully" and so the cycle goes on. My Daughter for some reason wanted to go to a boarding school, I suppose she was lucky in that the perfect who she "fagged for" did not ask her to do anything for her, she did not have to do the usual, make the bed, clean the room carry her bag etc etc and hence when my Daughter got to 6th form she mirrord the behaviour of who she fagged for and asked nothing from her Fag, and I would like to think that cycle continued
[9/12/23, 12:31:16 PM] Malcolm: I am very proud of my Daughter , in 6th year she was appointed as the junior's first point of contact should the be badly treated by any 6th forms
[9/12/23, 12:32:30 PM] Mark Finch: That is superb !
[9/12/23, 12:32:55 PM] Malcolm: Cheers @447917428535
[9/12/23, 12:35:12 PM] Peter Milne: So different now. In my role as an Educational Consultant I work a lot with independent schools, and they are doing amazing things on mental health, well-being, and citizenship. 40 years is a long time and bullies are a dying breed. Even in The Close, it was happening.
[9/12/23, 12:36:06 PM] Malcolm: So glad to hear that, no more "Bog washing"
[9/12/23, 12:36:19 PM] Alex Coomes: I feel exactly the same as many of my fellow “convicts “ at HMP Reeds perhaps we could have a class action group against the School? I am sure many former pupils of our year suffered PTSD it’s flavour of our present time- just suggesting!
[9/12/23, 12:37:10 PM] Pascal: I was given a toothbrush and told.to clean the toliets.
[9/12/23, 12:38:18 PM] Malcolm: Better than using your hair and head.I would struggle now being folicly challenged🤣
[9/12/23, 12:39:24 PM] Pascal: The bullying was taken on the cheek if you were physically big enough to take the hit. The rest just suffered more. As for the fagging it was just part the course although I can't remember asking anyone to "fag" for me or anyone in our year doing so.
[9/12/23, 12:39:42 PM] Barry Cawston: So in our upper 6th we banned dishing and I was very happy about that but apparently a few years later somehow it reappeared … funny old world
[9/12/23, 12:40:04 PM] Pascal: Ah
[9/12/23, 12:42:07 PM] Pascal: I have a feeling we all pushed all the fagging crap aside, intuitively . There was No need and no point. Or is that my memory and we were all sadists...?
[9/12/23, 12:42:09 PM] Malcolm: I will certainly be at the reunion, but I think this group has enabled a few of us a platform to vent and for that @447917428535  I will be eternally grateful
[9/12/23, 12:44:08 PM] Pascal: A different moment in time now.

[9/12/23, 12:45:50 PM] Peter Milne: Totally agree. I pushed Reeds away for decades. Mainly because I remember how cruel people can be. I guess sport was my release, and now, as a parent, teacher, and consultant, bullying has zero tolerance.
[9/12/23, 12:45:51 PM] Barry Cawston: Yep the time felt right to call an end to dishing … we went through the mill and rather than repeat it we  actively worked to change the course … 

Amazing that so many voices and stories are being told and heard 

🕺🏻
[9/12/23, 12:45:52 PM] Malcolm: Folicly challenge me walking my daughter to the Chapel
[9/12/23, 12:47:18 PM] Barry Cawston: Ha ha 
My hair is long but only as my waste is wide 😁
[9/12/23, 12:49:00 PM] Pascal: Go to Turkey and get it sorted
[9/12/23, 12:49:17 PM] Pascal: It's true you have a good head of hair...
[9/12/23, 12:49:20 PM] Pascal: And waist

[9/12/23, 12:53:10 PM] Barry Cawston: My life in a nut shell

From Boris Becker to Boris Johnson via Boris Baggs and Boris Yeltsin
[9/12/23, 12:53:41 PM] Malcolm: Last rant but what really concerns me is that we were Kids aged between 13 and 18, the teachers were adults they knew what was happening and yet did nothing and for that the should be ashamed
[9/12/23, 12:57:56 PM] Peter Milne: I thank that the World is different now, but it does explain why so many politicians have been so crap! 25 years as a teacher. Many changes. Some of those Reeds teachers would now be sacked or even in prison!
[9/12/23, 12:58:15 PM] Pascal: some of the teachers took a shinning to the boys...Mr Potts...? And his late night gatherings.and Mr Xxx lifting the shower curtain to make sure we were having a cold shower...
[9/12/23, 12:58:55 PM] Pascal: Mr...can't remember his name. Lived in a hose near one of the entrances tot eh school. English teacher.
[9/12/23, 1:01:02 PM] Pascal: Caning and plimsolls. Had both: plimsolls at the close for writing a lewd letter to a girl...how did they find it..? Did they read the letters...
[9/12/23, 1:05:16 PM] Peter Milne: I got the slipper for exploring the air raid shelter that was hidden in the broom cupboard at the Close. Anybody remember that place?
[9/12/23, 1:09:10 PM] Tom Hardiment: My brother warned me that I would be bullied v badly, just as he was. He hated every second of his early years at Reeds.

In my first term (3rd form), the day after the house music competition (where for some reason I got 19 out of 20 for the junior house music competition just playing a piece I learnt for grade 4 at my last school), I was at the revolving toaster when a house mate came up to me and said "Terry Gilyer wants to see you on the top table". 
Cacking myself I walked slowly over to face the Mullens upper 6th. Like a firing squad.

Terry G puts his hand out and says "Put it there Hardiment. Great job last night"

It was like instant protection from the mob.

My brother was so pissed off I was never bullied like he was.

Never thought taking up the trumpet at the age of 7 would buy me protection 6 years later.
[9/12/23, 1:11:19 PM] Barry Cawston: Hence your major roll in the ladder serenade
[9/12/23, 1:13:39 PM] Nick Carey: I learnt very quickly to play the gormless lump (yes, yes, I know 🤣) as, although it frustrated them a bit, they never had anything to have a proper go at, I wasnt sport, therefore boring and largely ignored (except Ian Organ)
[9/12/23, 1:14:42 PM] Nick Carey: It was good! I can still remember how impressed everybody was 😁
[9/12/23, 1:24:18 PM] Tom Hardiment: Thanks Nick. Wasn't trying to blow my own trumpet there btw. Just saying it's a fine line between those feckers choosing to bully you or finding some other poor soul to pick on.

Pascal is right - we all evolved by the time we got to the top and had better things to do with our time
[9/12/23, 1:25:52 PM] Pascal: Yep
[9/12/23, 1:45:08 PM] Jon R: Remember Shaun’s Flock of Seagulls haircut?
[9/12/23, 1:46:06 PM] Barry Cawston: Once seen never forgotten
[9/12/23, 2:01:25 PM] Pascal: 👨‍🎤
[9/12/23, 2:02:36 PM] Mark Finch: I have just spat my tea out ! Hilarious !
[9/12/23, 2:11:19 PM] James Eason: Yes, we also mentioned this some way back in this thread in respect of the standard of teaching; appalling. I suspect that when Rodney Exton left and Tyson took over the whole thing probably descended into chaos behind the scenes. We might not have been able to discern that at the time. I feel sorry for my parents shelling out good cash for that. I pay good money for my (13yo) daughter’s education and I damned well get something that transcends the academic instruction I had there - the sport is better too, but that’s another story.  On one hand I am a touch proud to have had a public school education, but I did feel that it was oddly ‘awkward’; I get the feeling that this is what a few of us felt - speaking candidly, I am clutching on to the thought that we all actually have a common bond that might run comfortingly deeper than we know.
[9/12/23, 2:20:11 PM] Peter Milne: I agree. For me, there have always been buried emotions, and I thought that maybe it was just me. There are so many common bonds, and I am looking forward to a few beers and laughter next year.
[9/12/23, 2:25:13 PM] Barry Cawston: 🙏. Oh and I mean that in a well said way not a Sunday chapel service thing
[9/12/23, 2:30:35 PM] Barry Cawston: Got to love a well directed emoji in our day is was a black board rubber
[9/12/23, 2:32:55 PM] James Eason: Or at best an acerbic and demeaning remark…
[9/12/23, 2:40:52 PM] James Eason: Didn’t we have a Piranha named Jim in the Chemistry lab?
[9/12/23, 2:49:52 PM] Barry Cawston: Now I can’t remember Jim but I can remember a fish called Wanda
[9/12/23, 3:00:14 PM] Mark Finch: LOVE this ! What is crystal clear to me is that when we got to the 6th form, we broke the bullying cycle. That has been clear talking to teachers (not Masters !!!) after we left. I think the best measure of that is how many - who were a year or two below - have always echoed that sentiment and been good friends so I think we can hold our heads high and give ourselves a collective pat on the back !!! 

Nick @447305534304 - I totally get where you are coming from re your experience with Ian Organ. Mine was Nick “the animal” Taylor.  Having been right royally pummelled black and blue for “looking at him in the wrong way” - bearing in mind he was 16 and I was 12 - I promised myself that one day, …just one day…I felt cheated in that I found out a couple of years ago he died in a car accident in his 20s. Maybe there is a God @447305534304!!! That is a truly appalling thing for me to type. Sorry in advance. But it’s cathartic. Nick said it way better. It’s the only grudge I have ever held - and it ran very deep !!!

On a more “positive” and entertaining point - yet again I was on the wrong side of a pummelling ! Someone - a year above - can’t remember his name - beat up Pixie. I objected to that so I biffed him quite hard. Unfortunately his buddy - let’s just call him “mad dog” -  came in our dorm at 11.30 one night and ambushed me. Public thanks to Fred Shawkat @447786337137 for pulling him off me. I was black and blue and the next day was Sports Day. My folks were over from the Middle East. My old man was not one to mess with (think Jason Leonard). I only just managed to stop my folks from piling into Tyson’s office.  “Mad-dog” and I now laugh about it, and I would differentiate from the previous “incident” where I probably deserved what I got and it was “even” match. Heaven knows how many times we had to dig ourselves  out of a situation Pixie got us in 😂😂😂 And we loved it ! 😘
[9/12/23, 3:02:23 PM] Barry Cawston: All emojis!
[9/12/23, 3:04:04 PM] John Vocking: I, and I don’t suspect I’m alone in this, have had a mixed and varied relationship with my past at boarding schools. At times Reed’s was the making or the breaking of me. Often both at the same time. 

I left after o levels more because I wanted to make friends locally, and meet girls too. Being a boarder and far from school meant for long lonely holidays, along with the odd scrap with the local school kids. I did have Geoffrey trying to persuade me to stay, with some entertaining offers, but my mind was made up and I enjoyed two great years at 6th form. 

However that did not mean I did not enjoy my time at Reed’s. The camaraderie, as can be witnessed by this thread (Thanks again Finchie) the sports, music and facilities we had on tap and unsupervised at weekends. It also got a lot easier as you ascended the years too. 
There was bullying but I can’t say that has stayed with me but I expect I got away better than some. 

All in all I think I gained more than I lost. 

From an academic point I didn’t do too bad with 8 O levels, no A grades though. What did help me get those was Prep and Late Prep. After all there’s only so much time you can spend in classroom each evening before you may as am do your homework. At college I had non of those, as my results will attest. Forget education was not for me. 

Hunger is a memory from school, the constant yearning for any food. 
As a 3rd year I also remember crushing homesickness in the first few weeks and being unable to call home from that crappy phone booth by the changing rooms. Just get to the front of the queue only to be dished by 4th and 5th years. That passed and soon I would dread the end of term instead😳

It’s s peculiar world, that of a border in the 70s ands 80s
[9/12/23, 3:04:38 PM] Barry Cawston: I mentioned mine earlier was when I got mad with Ony and pinched him in the face 

He looked shocked and them smiled and walked off … it actually served me well 
Then there was Roger A ‘s sharp right hand that was brushed over as a squash injury !! 
The highs and lows
[9/12/23, 3:06:19 PM] John Vocking: Mr Procter, creepy af.
[9/12/23, 3:16:07 PM] Jon R: One night on prefect duty I found the 4th form dorm empty, they were all in Proctor’s room watching tv. All in pajamas sprawled around a small room including on his bed. He had to let me in when I knocked and his face looked guilty as shit. I stayed until each kid had left
[9/12/23, 3:57:37 PM] David Edwards: Can’t say I do!
[9/12/23, 11:13:00 PM] Alex Coomes: Some references to Headmaster Tyson have been made. Does anyone remember his first address to the whole school when he talked about “Aspects of the swimming pool” we all took the piss out of him for months about it. From what I remember the pool was a knackered old wreck covered with a rather nasty prefab fibreglass structure that if proposed today would not be granted planning permission
[9/12/23, 11:21:55 PM] Mark Finch: He was certainly a very, very odd ball ! The memory might be fading but I think he had bad breath 😂 The funny thing is, I see photos of his successor Dave Prince, now in his later years, and he looks similar to Tyson !
[9/12/23, 11:27:02 PM] Peter Milne: Death Breath
[9/12/23, 11:29:01 PM] Barry Cawston: I think Tyson was a bit like the swimming pool and would not have been granted planning permission today.
[9/12/23, 11:29:14 PM] Alex Coomes: He apparently died from an insect bite he got in Nepal
[9/12/23, 11:31:48 PM] Alex Coomes: I certainly would not have given him permission to do anything, particularly around children
[9/12/23, 11:37:29 PM] James Eason: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Baird_Tyson
[9/13/23, 6:31:54 AM] Haydar Shawkat: Interesting reading about Mr Tyson after so many years. I’ve always been grateful to him for allowing me into Reeds. I was 14 with English as a 2nd language and straight from a state school in Iraq. Lots of schools would not have me. But he did.
[9/13/23, 6:33:39 AM] Barry Cawston: From my limited interaction with him I would describe him as an extraordinary old fashioned character …
[9/13/23, 6:34:27 AM] Zaid Tuaima: A dying breed.
[9/13/23, 6:34:51 AM] Zaid Tuaima: He did have bad breath though.
[9/13/23, 6:35:24 AM] Barry Cawston: Shocking
[9/13/23, 6:35:38 AM] Zaid Tuaima: But like Haydar said if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have gotten into Reeds either.
[9/13/23, 6:45:04 AM] Paul Rushton: They do not handout MCs like smarties, it would be interesting to know how he won it. And an Oxford Scholar to boot. Obviously hidden depths to the man that we all only remember because of his halitosis.

I think that is a reflection on us rather than him.
[9/13/23, 6:48:29 AM] Barry Cawston: Maybe so but he did feel like he was ‘still abroad’  wandering the Hindu Kush  and for sure he wanted to be 
Kinda felt that his being a head master in Nepal would have been his calling … respect for the adventurous road he took !
[9/13/23, 6:52:56 AM] Graham Hales: Cheeky favour. I spoke at a sustainabliity conference today. I've posted the slides on Linked-in and would welcome any likes / reposts just to get the Linked-in algorithm to do its thing. I'm at https://www.linkedin.com/in/graham-hales-b4225414/ and very happy to connect with any of you. And yes, Mr Tyson had breath that would fell an elephant!
[9/13/23, 6:55:47 AM] James Eason: “….He was seconded to the Seaforth Highlanders in Malaya during the Emergency. His platoon located a temporary bandit camp in an overgrown rubber plantation but despite heavy fire from three Bren guns Tyson’s men continued to occupy a strategic position and eventually ambushed a group of communist guerrillas. Tyson was awarded an MC – recognising his courage in pursuing the retreating guerrillas and leading his men in a particularly hazardous patrol in the Segamat district….”
[9/13/23, 7:00:38 AM] Jon R: Good training for his stint at Reeds? 🙃
[9/13/23, 7:03:00 AM] Nick Carey: I had very little to do with him, so don’t have much skin in this game, but I am reminded of an adage that goes something like - 
evil men are capable of individual acts of great kindness and good men are capable of individual acts of great evil… 
Not sure where he fits in that pantheon though…
[9/13/23, 7:07:34 AM] Mark Finch: Connection pending ;-)
[9/13/23, 7:08:53 AM] Mark Finch: Ah ha ! The man with the Telegraph subscription identified !! It was behind a paywall for me !! 😀
[9/13/23, 7:11:25 AM] William Pendered: Well I must be very thankful of that one and much appreciated to this day Mark 🙏👍
[9/13/23, 7:11:28 AM] James Eason: No, not me gov! It was from a Scottish paper…!
[9/13/23, 7:11:57 AM] James Eason: Same here.
[9/13/23, 7:12:01 AM] Mark Finch: Haha. You passed !
[9/13/23, 7:15:31 AM] Barry Cawston: On a post Reed’s note I must have lost my marbles early as I ended up inter railing with Pixie around Europe 

It was Ummh how shall I put this …quite lively
[9/13/23, 7:16:24 AM] William Pendered: Memorable perhaps Baz?
[9/13/23, 7:17:12 AM] Barry Cawston: All I will say is 
Cows
Passport 
And Croatia
[9/13/23, 7:17:28 AM] Nick Carey: Is the failed “doing a runner” story true?
[9/13/23, 7:17:41 AM] Barry Cawston: Loved it mate 
What a laugh
[9/13/23, 7:17:52 AM] Barry Cawston: Yes
[9/13/23, 7:17:52 AM] William Pendered: Quick change of subject. Just secured ticket for Japan match in Nice on Sunday. Any if you 84ers there, would be cool?
[9/13/23, 7:18:08 AM] William Pendered: Runner!
[9/13/23, 7:18:18 AM] Barry Cawston: There you have it
[9/13/23, 7:24:39 AM] Mark Finch: There was another “doing a runner” story in the Oxford hockey 6s tournament. I nipped to the loo, got back and everyone has done a runner. I was held hostage ! I have no recollection of how it got resolved 😂
[9/13/23, 7:31:00 AM] William Pendered: Now that does ring a bell! I was obviously not one to have around when attempting a runner. Recall like my Croatia experience we returned tail between our legs to square up and get you released Mark
[9/13/23, 7:32:22 AM] Barry Cawston: I have to say that in my experience the ‘runner’ was never very successful 

Feel like tequila took the edge of the required skill set
[9/13/23, 7:57:03 AM] Peter Milne: Happy to do so. That is my line of work, too, with UK and global schools
[9/13/23, 8:01:04 AM] Barry Cawston: That sounds interesting @447710742347 

I am thinking to put together a book called Green Pages of ‘green ‘ companies and initiatives as I have come across some great projects including ones started by are own Ollie Pendered no less…
[9/13/23, 8:06:55 AM] Peter Milne: Great idea. Can I count myself in. www.beyondcop21symposium.org

[9/13/23, 8:22:52 AM] Paul Rushton: Don’t tread on an ant he’s done nothing to you…… there might come a day when he’s treading on you. 

I saw Pascal last weekend we were talking about this.
[9/13/23, 8:23:11 AM] Paul Rushton: Hilarious
[9/13/23, 8:24:00 AM] Barry Cawston: @447495602526 that would be an easy yes 
I am working on several projects and some come to fruition and some lay fallow and some I just clearly forget I ever had 

But talking to some people about funding .. it’s been bubbling for a while
[9/13/23, 8:58:28 AM] Andrew Marsh: I remember that radio !
[9/13/23, 8:58:38 AM] William Pendered: I'm sure Ollie would welcome all in
[9/13/23, 9:18:26 AM] Jon R: Jeez I’m having flashbacks now!!
[9/13/23, 9:23:55 AM] Jon R: I feel I must have blanked reeds out seeing these anecdotes and snippets is playing havoc! It’s like waking up after a particularly heavy sesh and the events of the night before come drip feeding through to haunt your day!!😟
[9/13/23, 9:24:24 AM] Jon R: In a good way…🙂
[9/13/23, 9:38:50 AM] John Vocking: No point in coming to me 😳
[9/13/23, 9:44:40 AM] John Vocking: I was talking to a bloke outside a car parts place, in Woking, discussing upgrades to the Audi TT when we suddenly realised we knew each other🤣
That was in 2003/4 i think. He was working for Accenture back then. Not seen him since though.
[9/13/23, 9:46:27 AM] Barry Cawston: I seem to remember that Sean was into Cars and Quiffs … makes sense somehow
[9/13/23, 9:47:58 AM] John Vocking: @14168040878 and I, plus a few others ,will remember a particular afternoon with Sean in the 5th year common room
[9/13/23, 9:48:15 AM] Jon R: Otherwise referred to as the hairdressers Audi….seems he never shook the fascination with hairstyles (refer Flock of Seagulls)
[9/13/23, 9:50:40 AM] Jo Chan: @447876775581, my memory is horrid, can’t remember what I had for dinner.
[9/13/23, 10:05:32 AM] John Vocking: That’s good
[9/13/23, 12:47:43 PM] Pascal: That is the model...
[9/13/23, 12:50:17 PM] Pascal: John Vocking: you have a weird techno memory...🤖...Why did you and Xxx (?) have a separate boys room where you could listen to Ultravox and OMD....(Funny how they haven't aged...the music I mean)?
[9/13/23, 12:55:44 PM] John Vocking: Separate boys room🤣🤣🤣
Don’t forget Kraftwerk. 
@16095169175 I remember listening to Rockwrok by early Ultravox in their university digs on top of some flash hotel in Brighton.
[9/13/23, 1:26:20 PM] Tom Hardiment: Hi Pascal.
Talking of musical memories:
One long Sunday arvo back in 1981, bored to feck, lying on my bed in the 5th form dorm you must have felt I needed a lift. You came over, gave me your Walkman and said listen to this. It was Heaven 17 - Penthouse and Pavement. I lay there and listened to the whole album. 40+ minutes of genius. Never forgotten that generosity. Ta much! Tx
[9/13/23, 1:32:52 PM] Andy Glass: Pasc you also introduced us all to the B52s….
[9/13/23, 1:34:22 PM] Jon R: Did you ever get over Vienna not getting to No1?
[9/13/23, 1:36:00 PM] Nick Carey: I’m pretty sure you introduced me to Bowie… quite the legacy Pascal!
[9/13/23, 1:36:10 PM] Tom Hardiment: And the stanglers, golden brown
[9/13/23, 1:36:38 PM] Pascal: Absolutely 👌👌👌
[9/13/23, 1:37:40 PM] Pascal: And Joy Division i hope 🤞🤞
[9/13/23, 1:39:15 PM] Pascal: Heard Heaven 17 on the Spotify the other day. We don't need that Fascist Groove thing. Great song.
[9/13/23, 1:40:41 PM] Pascal: Bowie 😍
[9/13/23, 1:41:22 PM] Tom Hardiment: Still holds up
[9/13/23, 1:41:38 PM] John Vocking: Just shut uppa your face Jon😉
[9/13/23, 1:45:31 PM] John Vocking: Yes, and some obscure Bowie at that.  @447952310564 I too remember Penthouse and Pavement. 
I also remember… i think @447889646381 & @447981273121 being obsessed with “Forget me not “ by Patrice Rushen. Also the heavy metal phase, especially AC/DC “A whole lotta Rosie”
[9/13/23, 1:51:01 PM] James Eason: @447889646381 you were well into AC/DC before Reed’s; we were singing Whole Lotta Rosie in the little blue bus that took us to Bloemendal for the cricket with Mike Gosling - released in 1977 (the song, not Mike). Along with The Stranglers - Peaches; Lou Reed.
[9/13/23, 2:00:38 PM] William Pendered: Yes
[9/13/23, 2:02:00 PM] James Eason: This talk of rock reminds me of Remnant and Eyre Varnier…. Any one have contact?
[9/13/23, 3:03:06 PM] Paul Rushton: I just played that song, I recognise it , the second line “help me to remember” can’t say that I do

[9/14/23, 3:01:40 AM] William Pendered: Exactly
[9/14/23, 3:01:56 AM] Andy Glass: I had a shocker!
[9/14/23, 3:03:30 AM] Dave Wilko: No that’s not completely true… shocker for few but much better back 9😀
[9/14/23, 3:19:40 AM] David Edwards: As usual…AG protecting and outrageous HC believing it will bring him sympathy in Tenerife!! 🤠
[9/14/23, 3:28:37 AM] William Pendered: Shocker until he mid match changed his handicap perhaps? Wilko I am guessing you are being indicted 🤣
[9/14/23, 3:28:51 AM] William Pendered: Inducted even
[9/14/23, 3:34:19 AM] Dave Wilko: 😂😂I’m saying nothing m’lord
[9/14/23, 4:27:28 AM] Andrew Shiells: Great fun and yes Andy’s head really is that big after photoshopping and remember only official WHS handicaps count everything else is like a trip to MS3  you get what you’re given and say thank you 😜
[9/15/23, 1:30:54 AM] Mike Nunan: Morning all, just chipping in as I've finally caught up with this chat, been looking at the unread count increasing crazily since the weekend (a v busy one for me) and didn't want to even open the group until I knew I'd have time to read through. So much here, it's amazing. @447957292015 think I took that photo of you in the magnetic tape - wasn't that from some computer storage spools that someone brought in? I remember them getting strewn around the woods as well. But I'm pretty sure I've got the negative of that shot and probably a bunch of others, I need to dig through some boxes. They need scanning for posterity before the deteriorate any further, like you did for yours @16504609902
[9/15/23, 1:33:31 AM] Mike Nunan: "HMP Reeds" 🤣🤣 that sums it up perfectly, I've often described the experience as like prison. Not sure I can be bothered with legal action but actually really good to know this was felt more widely, I came away with the feeling that I was just a wimp and didn't measure up to the challenge of the place
[9/15/23, 1:36:51 AM] Mike Nunan: Super job Pete on getting ChatGPT to solve our message history problem! Think it's looking like version 5 will potentially be a "strong" AI, we are indeed heading into unknown waters. For now, it's bloody useful. I've learned two new programming languages this year (first Python and now Rust) and being able to ask the bot to assist with bits of code has been a game-changer, can make progress so much faster that way, it's unreal

[9/15/23, 2:18:40 AM] Barry Cawston: Thought it might be good if we shared some tunes from back in the day … could be preparation for a rave in the Sandy Lane car park next June

Totally loved this album and tune
[9/15/23, 2:27:55 AM] Barry Cawston: Can I suggest that the B&W pic of the tape be reposted here and that it be used as the album cover for the first compilation and maybe the title is 

The Mix Tape
[9/15/23, 2:28:02 AM] Zaid Tuaima: In my opinion the best "new wave" band of the 80's.
[9/15/23, 2:28:18 AM] James Eason: I alway recall the Blathwayt JCR hen I hear this: https://youtu.be/zPwMdZOlPo8?si=AYIn9lqnCbdFs2I4

[9/15/23, 3:08:39 AM] James Eason: Okay, this might be slightly embarrassing, but you all know I had a bit of a thing for heavy rock, I must say I pretty much ignored that from 1984 to 2016(!) however, I bumped into a huge Glaswegian at a party down here in Hampshire, and we decided to put together a heavy rock band. This is the band, Stryke, and it’s our version of slither by velvet revolver. If you get bored of it in the early stages, there’s a good solo by Paul at 2’50”. We’d be happy to play at the reunion. https://youtu.be/plm6L9SHKMo?si=OxCh3tbfSy2z-AI4
[9/15/23, 3:10:09 AM] James Eason: PS there is no sound in the first 10 secs; that what how it was deliberately produced - no idea why; I am not a ‘creative’.
[9/15/23, 3:16:44 AM] Paul Rushton: You’re on base?
[9/15/23, 3:17:25 AM] Barry Cawston: Loved it and the video …
[9/15/23, 3:17:30 AM] Paul Rushton: *bass
[9/15/23, 3:17:59 AM] James Eason: Yes; I played lead guitar for a few years, but found bass was, frankly, easier and you can keep an eye on what everybody else is doing.

[9/15/23, 11:33:17 AM] Mike Nunan: Guilty as charged. Also for spending hours removing copy protection from titles on cassette tapes! I remember one winter's evening I'd played so much Pacman (or whatever the BBC clone of it was called) that when I walked out into the alleyway exiting the math lab I was faced with a residual image of a red ghost, approx 10 feet tall and plain as day. Think there was something about the food additives in the sweets from the tuck shop in those days that perhaps also had something to do with it...

Re-charted my life… 

“9-5 I spend my time at work, my job is boring I’m an office clerk “

I was so determined to avoid this fate (without ever actually having any kind of plan) I ended up in sales…

So I spent my 9-5 on a motorway instead in high pressure jobs I wasn’t entirely cut out to do… 

But at least I was never an office drone 🎉🍻🥳

[9/16/23, 12:03:08 PM] Mike Nunan: The record that changed the world for a few people in my circle. I did two UK tours with Bam as support DJ, my friend Dapo was his manager in Europe at the time so he tapped me for it. Those were some mad times, but the biggest moment was actually when he didn't turn up. This was a thing with him, he would have stuff going on in Brooklyn and just wouldn't get on a flight until days after his first booking was meant to be, used to drive Dapo nuts. So I got to play the headline slot at the Heavenly Social at Turnmills, packed night, still a queue round the corner at 1am. I wondered how many out of the 1500 or so in the venue came away wondering if Bambaataa was a skinny white boy 😉
[9/16/23, 12:03:54 PM] Mike Nunan: (Btw that was me as support DJ for Bam, not the other way around!)
[9/16/23, 12:06:02 PM] Peter Potts: That is possible using a YouTube API key, pull JSON from YouTube, perhaps same for Spotify and then create an Apple playlist in XML format for import somehow.

[9/17/23, 3:56:24 AM] Tim Clark: I think the list is lacking disco/dance and Adam and the Ants and Talking Heads… In the art room we had a record player and only 4 albums. Derek and Clive, Duran Duran-Rio, Randy Crawford and Krafwerk. My memory will probably make that 4 other albums tomorrow! Some teachers names I don’t recall from this chat, I don’t even remember the art teacher’s name. I’m going with Alan ?.He had faith in me but I lost faith in him when having said I could take art A level in one year he took that away and gave that slot to some else .. 🤷‍♂️
[9/17/23, 3:58:29 AM] Zaid Tuaima: Mr Dore (I think that's how u spell it) and Alan Williams (we went clubbing with him a couple of times).
[9/17/23, 4:05:55 AM] James Eason: I think this might make a better album cover, perhaps with the one of me and Roj taped up on the back; depending of course in what format it is, but it could be there, maybe just playing second fiddle to this awesome one.
[9/17/23, 4:07:42 AM] Tim Clark: I have more from then. Bloody brilliant. Looking at it now Chris is rocking a good David Sylvian look. (Add Japan to the list). The back story of that art trip to Amsterdam was had booked for some basic hostel or hotel but it was all double booked so .. for no extra charge we got put in the 4 star Carlton. We shared fancy suites and I don’t think we saw much ‘classic’ art!🤗
[9/17/23, 4:08:59 AM] Chris: Sorry to do it to Zaid? 😂😂😂

[9/17/23, 8:10:51 AM] Tom Hardiment: ‎This message was deleted.
[9/17/23, 8:28:45 AM] Tom Hardiment: Well remembered Finchie.
When he left Mr Williams replaced him. I did A level art with him. He was a useless teacher and a lazy fecker. He kept bunking off from teaching us to see his girlfriend in London. He asked us to cover for him each time but after a couple of terms we just said to Prince, when he put his head into the art studio, that he was in London.  He was sacked the next week.
His idea of teaching art was to say cut out a picture you like from a magazine, draw a grid over it scale it up and copy it.
Peter Thomas was a friend of Mr Prince and stood in for the last two terms and saved us all from certain failure.
Taught us to sculpt, screen print, throw pots; paint with oil, gouache and water colour and draw with conte, pastel and charcoal. Still life, life classes and from nature.
Without the A for art A Level I wouldn't have got to uni. Whoever employed Mr Williams should've been sacked too.

Still in touch with Peter. He lives in the Dordogne and exhibits in London each year. Lovely guy.

In the studio we (Rob Lee, James G, Joe Moreton and Joe Chan, & Mrs Martin!) listened to Fleetwood Mac - Rumours, Rickie Lee Jones and Van Morrison - Astral Weeks, drank a lot of tea and dyed our hair with peroxide. Good times.
[9/17/23, 8:39:31 AM] Tim Clark: Ok that makes sense. What was his Christian name? He was the one I was taking about. I think he took us to Amsterdam
[9/17/23, 8:46:25 AM] Jo Chan: Did you remember Mr Thomas took us to Hampton Court and we had a lovely picnic with the castle in the backdrop. He was a fine artist. In paint and in life.
[9/17/23, 8:47:09 AM] Tim Clark: Not sure about my memory. I’m sorry to say I don’t remember any of those names mentioned. Prince, etc. I remember Joe Chan, went into graphic design  I think. I recall the albums we had in the art room were DEREK and Clive, Randy Crawford, Duran Duran and Kraftwerk I think . ‎<This message was edited>

[9/17/23, 2:53:17 PM] Tim Clark: I had good memories in Nice(Antibes etc), either with you, Pascal or Richard. I did sleep on the street once, all my stuff was locked in at the train station. We used to sleep on the beach too and get hosed down by the street cleaners at 3 am... not sure who I was with, might even have been with other people after school...Got a rifle pointed at us as we would try our luck (again at night)under the concrete awnings of the private beach clubs, and the guard would try and scare us off.. And of course I remember Talking Heads. We went a filmed Wembley concert... not the Stop Making Sense film..
[9/17/23, 2:55:06 PM] Pascal: Yep. Nudging the memories back. It was Stop Making sense: he wore the large zoot suit
[9/17/23, 2:55:38 PM] Pascal: 🫣....remind me again...

[9/17/23, 3:46:24 PM] Mike Nunan: Yes indeed, but not in any big or professional way. Something I've enjoyed doing though since being a kid with a 126 instamatic. Goes in fits and starts a bit, had a fallow period around lockdown but carrying a camera a lot more again now. Still have a lot of film gear but a long time now since I used it. Fuji X series cameras handle pretty much like the old school kit which is nice. Re faces I'm dreadful, found out a few years back there is a condition known as face -blindness, think I must have it, can be very embarrassing. Some randomly stick but more often not, please everyone cut me slack at the reunion if I don't clock who you are 🙏🏻

[9/19/23, 12:46:55 AM] Mark Finch: I have good news. Flying back tonight EasyJet, so no doubt will be delayed - I’ll update the playlist 😂

Meanwhile, someone asked for some disco. That was my bag 😂

[9/29/23, 6:55:59 AM] ~ Mark: That might be me in hockey goal.  As a I remember I was only selected once (for my height and arm length only), let in 7 goals and for some reason never got picked again.
[9/29/23, 7:01:05 AM] William Pendered: Kayaking in a pool 🤣
[9/29/23, 7:01:30 AM] William Pendered: Who's that in rugby one apart from AD?
[9/29/23, 7:08:04 AM] Andy Glass: Tom H at the front
[9/29/23, 7:12:20 AM] Alex Coomes: Recognise Jamie Moreton at back on right at slanted desk
[9/29/23, 7:13:43 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: Me and Finchie with Mad Frank
[9/29/23, 7:15:21 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: Chris and Barry is that you studying hard with AD standing in the back?
[9/29/23, 7:16:33 AM] Barry Cawston: Think it’s Greg Anderson in the rugby photo for some reason thinking he’s in a mosh pit
[9/29/23, 7:18:40 AM] Barry Cawston: Yes Duncan I actually remember the shoot because it was like we never ever studied like that 
I mean that many of us at one time no way
[9/29/23, 7:18:59 AM] Barry Cawston: Great trove Andy
[9/29/23, 7:19:01 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: Not even in that room!
[9/29/23, 7:20:55 AM] Andrew Marsh: Great photos - My wife tells me that I’m the one at the back - to the left of the slanty  desk - albeit she nearly did not recognise me with a full head of hair !
[9/29/23, 7:21:52 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: Is that the six form library?
[9/29/23, 7:22:16 AM] Barry Cawston: Was there a sixth form library ?
[9/29/23, 7:22:36 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: 🤣
[9/29/23, 7:23:16 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: Just down the corridor from the school, captains office
If you turn left, you went to the music rooms and the changing rooms
[9/29/23, 7:23:29 AM] Paul Rushton: Seated in the middle at the back Peter Griffin?
[9/29/23, 7:25:20 AM] Barry Cawston: That’s a classic photo
[9/29/23, 7:25:27 AM] Paul Rushton: Seated on the left at the front?
[9/29/23, 7:25:59 AM] Andy Glass: Roger Moore
[9/29/23, 7:36:13 AM] Jo Chan: Is this Mr Weir? The maths teacher. He was a nice easy going guy.

[9/29/23, 8:28:30 AM] John Vocking: That’s the Quiet Room. Favourite venue for 3hr Sunday Detention. Guy Wood is also in that picture.

[9/29/23, 11:24:52 PM] Mark Finch: Yes ! Loved Mad Frank. Sadly passed away in the last couple of years !
[9/30/23, 12:33:52 AM] Jon R: 😂 just how staged is that. Apart from maybe Roger Moore you’d not see those poses repeated by the others in the natural course of their day !!
[9/30/23, 2:13:31 AM] Alex Coomes: Yes it was all staged! if any prospective parents saw what in reality it was actually  like no self respecting parents would ever have let their little darlings anywhere near the place but instead inform social services.

[10/2/23, 2:33:56 PM] Mark Finch: Aka “Tommy” ?!
[10/2/23, 3:10:28 PM] Tim Clark: Yup, had forgotten that as well. Why Tommy?

[10/2/23, 11:54:20 PM] Graham Hales: Thomas Arthur Monkton Steadman. Used to have to support himself on the walls as he walked the corridors at night and I remember him having his pants on a boil wash in the study. Formative years!
[10/3/23, 5:44:32 AM] Tim Clark: I wish I had never asked! I remember some weird shit about him which I don’t even want to recall here. Graham. You were the Alan Parsons Project fan. I listened to him for the first time since 1984.. some cool toons going on there. Do you still sail?
[10/9/23, 11:26:15 AM] Graham Hales: Hello all, I'm currently completing a coaching course and need to build my hours / experience. Does anyone fancy a bit of coaching? No preparation is required on your part and it can involve any aspect of your life, just something you want to work through to get the outcome you're looking for. Lots of people approach coaching without a defined objective, so don't worry if you don't have a burning issue; I just need eager participants and thought this could be a user friendly place to start and a nice way to get to know each other again. All in strictest confidence of course. All on zoom so not logistical headaches. Please just message me on 07710742347 if you're interested and I'll let you know more, g.
[10/9/23, 1:16:19 PM] Mark Finch: Very interesting Grahame. I’ll be in touch !
[10/9/23, 1:30:53 PM] Barry Cawston: Hi Graham 
It’s been a while 
Wandering what type of coaching it is as I’ve for many reasons I’ve come across quite lots of different types over the last few years  almost all seem very worthwhile …
[10/9/23, 1:31:44 PM] David Edwards: Ist rule of building a positive rapport with your new coach is spelling his name right! 😂
[10/9/23, 1:32:21 PM] Barry Cawston: Ha. Ha 

V true Deve
[10/9/23, 9:56:37 PM] Graham Hales: It’s called an ILM Level 7. It’s basically Executive Coaching, but please don’t be put off by that! The Exec level just denotes the level you can go to within an organisation. At this stage I just need a volume of people to coach so I can create insights from my experience for my coursework. The techniques of business/ life coaching all follow the same principles and it’s really just focused on helping people get what they want out of any aspect of life, be it work or personal.
[10/9/23, 9:58:05 PM] Graham Hales: When you’re called Graham you get used to it!
[10/10/23, 11:27:27 AM] James Eason: Quick question to the group: is anybody aware of an investment company called Fisher Investments?  Just wondered if anybody knew of them, had any experiences on them, etc. https://www.fisherinvestments.com/en-gb
[10/10/23, 11:36:05 AM] Peter Potts: Read this first:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B0041842TW
[10/10/23, 12:02:02 PM] David Edwards: Sorry…have not come across them.
[10/10/23, 12:23:45 PM] Andrew Marsh: James - never used them. However fund  manager reviews make interesting reading.
[10/10/23, 12:25:07 PM] James Eason: Indeed they do!
[10/10/23, 12:25:47 PM] James Eason: Thanks Peter; I am not so much a novice at investing, just thought I’d see from the group if anyone had something to say about them.
[10/10/23, 1:11:48 PM] Peter Potts: I have not, but I do have trouble trusting any financial institution. I found this book particularly revealing about how the whole industry operates and it gives really good practical advice. The book is US based in its examples, but the message is the same for the UK.
[10/10/23, 1:12:28 PM] James Eason: Quite agree! I will be reading the article!
[10/10/23, 1:20:16 PM] Peter Potts: It's a book, but not that long and pretty easy going.
[10/11/23, 7:48:40 AM] Alex Coomes: There are very few active fund managers that will outperform the index and they all charge a small fortune and in my view cannot justify their fees the small investor is better off buying index trackers and investing in various markets as the old adage goes don’t keep all your eggs in one basket! Ie spread your risk to prevent loosing it all,  unfortunately there  are plenty of snake oil salesmen who would tell you otherwise
[10/11/23, 7:58:41 AM] Jon R: I keep a beer fund if anyone is keen to support as an angel investor….🙃
[10/11/23, 8:00:16 AM] Paul Rushton: Is it paying dividends atm
[10/11/23, 8:04:38 AM] Jon R: Asset liquidity - a core economic principle!
[10/11/23, 8:06:02 AM] Andrew Shiells: Maybe ask Rome for his opinion 😳
[10/11/23, 8:07:55 AM] Peter Potts: If you read the book, one trick that active fund managers do, is to shutdown underperforming funds, so it always looks like they are beating the market. Also, high return requires high risk, low return comes from low risk, but if you average the saw tooth of high returns over economic cycles, you find that the overall returns are similar often. So, why stress yourself.
[10/11/23, 8:14:27 AM] Peter Potts: Another point to consider is that a reasonable return on an investment (after all expenses and taxes) over decades might be 4%. A typically active fund manager charges at least 1%. So, you are losing 25% of your profits right there before you even get out of the gate. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/11/23, 8:18:39 AM] Peter Potts: In contrast, for example, the VTSAX Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares, only charges 0.04% per year.
Unfortunately, this is a US example and may not be appropriate for a UK investor. But you get the idea.
[10/11/23, 8:22:39 AM] Alex Coomes: You are right in your above assessment however when you take fees into account more often than not you will be behind the curve the top quartile will usually outperform the index - what about the other 75% ? Would not want them managing my ill-gotten funds!  what I will say is  some investment is better than none no matter what  you choose  also don’t forget tax benefits if done correctly - remember compound interest is a marvellous thing!!!
[10/11/23, 8:29:40 AM] Peter Potts: The book details many examples from the last 100 years about "outperforming the index". It's an interesting read.
Absolutely. Investment should be about long term, which means compound interest, so losing 25% of profits every year, is devastating to compound interest. And tax management is also critical as you mention. Compound interest in a "tax-free" account is a beautiful thing and makes a big difference.
[10/11/23, 8:36:26 AM] Paul Rushton: You glad you asked now?
[10/11/23, 8:40:04 AM] Alex Coomes: Will add it to my reading list
[10/11/23, 8:53:38 AM] Jon R: All divis to be reinvested ….

For my two pennies worth

Preferably an artist you know 😁

[10/11/23, 8:58:49 AM] Alex Coomes: There is no capital gains to pay  on artwork!
[10/11/23, 9:01:59 AM] Paul Rushton: Think you will find that is only on Wine and Cars
[10/11/23, 9:17:25 AM] Alex Coomes: I was under the impression it was on paintings as well - rules might have changed since I last purchased a constable
[10/11/23, 9:22:35 AM] Barry Cawston: Harry constables’ work is below the threshold
[10/11/23, 9:30:56 AM] Alex Coomes: Probably right in that assumption needs to be a Picasso before the taxman comes knocking
[10/11/23, 10:44:59 AM] James Eason: Yeah, defo good input!

[10/11/23, 11:46:53 PM] Mark Finch: Welcome Nael Akrawi !! And sorry you have not been on any “target” lists ! I used the original “Old Reedonian” booklets, in the “Vallete” (Andy Glass @447889646381 you did Latin - no idea what that means !). 
There are a handful of folks that were not on that list !!!
[10/11/23, 11:47:11 PM] Mark Finch: Thanks for the connection @447896340167  !
[10/11/23, 11:47:43 PM] Mark Finch: BTW - the Spotify playlist is up to date !!! …
[10/11/23, 11:48:58 PM] Mark Finch: I stuck it on Spotify as a public playlist. 
https://spotify.link/O1QuFEIeaDb
[10/11/23, 11:49:26 PM] Mark Finch: You boys have all kept me on my toes there !!!
[10/11/23, 11:50:08 PM] Mark Finch: Maybe a couple to add. Will be stuck at an airport soon 😂
[10/11/23, 11:51:35 PM] Mark Finch: We have made a bit of progress with a handful, but my “sales” technique is lacking. Give it time !!!
[10/11/23, 11:52:35 PM] ~ Niel Akrawi: Thanks and good to be here.
[10/11/23, 11:55:06 PM] ~ Niel Akrawi: I left in ‘85 but was one of the old gits so I guess I also count as ‘84.
[10/11/23, 11:56:33 PM] Mark Finch: Ah Ha ! That’s why I couldn’t find you ! Oops !
[10/11/23, 11:58:47 PM] Mark Finch: I know Zaid’s memory is hazy in his old age !!! So just a little yellow card 😂

So we are still stuck at 39 “genuine” class of ‘84 leavers !!
[10/12/23, 12:01:30 AM] Mark Finch: I have about 3 that I can’t nudge to commit ! And Nick Carey has one. 

Just to update you Nael, the commitment to be part of this exclusive group is £1000. Goes to charity and send it my way.
[10/12/23, 12:06:31 AM] Mark Finch: I also think we have our first “volunteer” to do the same for the year below - ‘85 leavers - as I think many agree it has quite a journey reconnecting so far !!!!
[10/12/23, 12:08:02 AM] ~ Niel Akrawi: Sounds like a plan.
[10/12/23, 12:37:48 AM] Malcolm: Niel, good to see your name, I still have horrific memories or you me and Tim Robb in Crete
[10/12/23, 12:48:54 AM] ~ Niel Akrawi: The suede brush :)
[10/12/23, 12:50:24 AM] ~ Niel Akrawi: Did you recently send me a Facebook request ?
Tend to keep off it as there seem to be too many scammers on there hence I have not yet accepted.
[10/12/23, 12:50:38 AM] ~ Niel Akrawi: Great to hear from you as well.
[10/12/23, 12:57:31 AM] Zaid Tuaima: There a lot of truth to that. BTW I left in 83 so I guess technically I don't qualify either.
[10/12/23, 1:04:05 AM] Mark Finch: Ah ha ! My game, my rules. I thought about this long and hard. 
It was anyone who was part of the class that eventually left in 6 two (A level year) in 1984. i.e. who were any part of the journey with that year group. Seemed to make the most sense. 
Take the example of Garfield Hatton who may have left in ‘81. There is no incentive for him to go to the ‘81 reunion as that would be mostly the six formers 3 or 4 years older than him. No one to share experience and memories with. So he should be part of the Class of ‘84, as are you !!! Make sense ? 😀 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/12/23, 1:05:34 AM] Zaid Tuaima: Is anyone in touch with Garfield?
[10/12/23, 1:07:24 AM] Mark Finch: Another good example is Kieron Barry Hawe. While mostly the year above through school, he retook his A levels, so for that last year, he was with us, and had a lot of fun and great memories of - so would love to get him board !
[10/12/23, 1:08:12 AM] Mark Finch: Sadly not. Hopefully we can track him down.
[10/12/23, 1:11:08 AM] Malcolm: I'm in the same position
[10/12/23, 1:11:58 AM] Mark Finch: And a great cricketer too ! 😂
[10/12/23, 1:22:30 AM] Paul Rushton: Chris Notton is another, sure that will be an incorrect spelling.
[10/12/23, 1:26:00 AM] Mark Finch: Absolutely Willie !. I have tracked him down, but he is not responding. I think this can be quite intimidating. I’ll ping the details to you as I’m sure you’ll have better luck !
[10/12/23, 1:28:09 AM] Paul Rushton: Ok mate
[10/12/23, 1:52:21 AM] Zaid Tuaima: Did any of the 39 have brothers/fathers/grandfathers that also attended Reeds?
[10/12/23, 1:53:32 AM] Andrew Shiells: My brother did as did Pixie’s (best buddies too) and then my two boys went 🤗
[10/12/23, 1:56:37 AM] Zaid Tuaima: Bet your boys had a better time of it than we did. They had girls and a bar to let off steam. I went to Reeds out of term a few years ago with my wife. The basics were still there but everything was obviously upgraded. However it seems to have gotten smaller. How much land did they sell off in the interim?
[10/12/23, 2:01:59 AM] James Eason: I left in ‘82, but started in the close in ‘77, therefore had 5 full years with the (‘84) gang - should have stayed the extra two. Yeah, all about the journey and all that…
[10/12/23, 2:04:49 AM] Zaid Tuaima: You paid your dues and deserve to be in 😁
[10/12/23, 2:04:52 AM] Jon R: Think you were right to get out early! Think Reeds legacy was strong before we were there but had morphed into something quite poor in all respects by the time we were there but seems to have improved a lot since
[10/12/23, 2:13:21 AM] James Eason: Yes, I guess we were just in the right place at the wrong time, except for the fact that we all have this group and network who’ve all experienced the same.
[10/12/23, 2:17:11 AM] Zaid Tuaima: I'm finding that we didn't all experience the same.
[10/12/23, 2:23:59 AM] Jon R: And it seems we’ve all thrived despite Reeds’ best efforts 😂
[10/12/23, 2:24:39 AM] James Eason: Yes, this is very true, and interesting.
[10/12/23, 2:25:32 AM] James Eason: It seems to have set us up all nicely.
[10/12/23, 2:39:25 AM] Andrew Shiells: They had a great time still keep in touch with many of their peers 7 & 5 years on. Mind you I may be in the minority on this chat but I had a great time (maybe shit exam results) with all the sport and some good mates several of whom I’m still in contact with. I think our era at any boarding school was challenging with physical discipline still acceptable and antiestablishment youths creeping in. Having worked there and another school for 14 years treating sports injuries it’s a whole new world these days with better facilities and teachers.  Just costs a fortune to go so the foundation side at Reeds makes it possible for quite a few more to get the experience & brings a little exposure to the privileged too of others not so fortunate 🤗
[10/12/23, 2:53:11 AM] Zaid Tuaima: I had a great time too but as a day boy after 8.30pm prep my time was my own. I remember you lived close to us. Were you a border or DB?
[10/12/23, 2:59:06 AM] Paul Rushton: Some of the content of this chat has saddened me , there are obviously people in here who had some dreadful experiences at Reeds. 

Andy I’m glad to see someone write they had a great time because so did I.
[10/12/23, 3:10:22 AM] Haydar Shawkat: I look back at Reeds with mixed feelings but overall I had a good time during some very formative years. Being a border and living in London meant that I lost touch with most of this group after leaving which was a shame. I don’t think I’d change anything though.
[10/12/23, 3:16:15 AM] Barry Cawston: I too had a great time and boarding and living close gave me the best of both worlds but I am not surprised by some of the grievances aired. 
Different world then and Reed’s was behind the curve of change in many ways. 
But many hilarious moments and the fact that so many of the year are on here proves the camaraderie we had.

[10/12/23, 3:16:58 AM] Andrew Shiells: DB yes Somerville Rd you were Eaton park 1st house
[10/12/23, 3:54:32 AM] James Eason: I definitely had a good time there and enjoyed it. I look back at it very fondly and my one regret really was not keeping him with the network and making stronger friendships with so many people in this group. That was a mistake, not deliberate, I just got on with life and my career. But of course it’s still early days and I would like to rekindle some of those friendships and make the most of it. I am proud to have been at Reeds and speak highly of it in many many ways.
[10/12/23, 3:57:46 AM] James Eason: My daughter loves the Spotify tape; she loves the 80s vibe generally, but says this is very real. Not like some of the saccharine 80s stuff that’s peddled.
[10/13/23, 1:15:55 AM] Zaid Tuaima: Well remembered. You lived 10 mins walk from me.
[10/25/23, 9:54:49 AM] William Pendered: Just saw the sad news about Eric Hearle 😓
[10/25/23, 10:12:13 AM] Mark Finch: Oh no. Where ?
[10/25/23, 10:19:18 AM] William Pendered: Yesterday, apparently fighting cancer for some time. Received an email from sharmaine
[10/25/23, 10:19:53 AM] Jon R: Dear Jon

It is with a heavy heart I write to inform you that very sadly former master, Eric Hearle, passed away yesterday.  As an OR who attended the School sometime during his tenure between 1971 and 2003, I am sure that you will have come across Mr Hearle who was, by all accounts, a larger than life character!

I was very touched to have just received a note from his son, Nick, in which he explained that Eric had been managing to live with cancer for some time but, at the end, it all happened very quickly.   

Nick has kindly agreed to keep me updated which I will share as appropriate.

Should you wish to write to the family, please do let me know.    
 
With thanks and best wishes,
Sharmaine 
Head of Alumni & Community Relations, Reed's School
[10/25/23, 10:33:25 AM] Nick Carey: Aw, that is sad. Really liked Eric, some great memories 💔
[10/25/23, 10:33:45 AM] Zaid Tuaima: rip. Never knew him that well but he did take us for rugby in the 3rd form.
[10/25/23, 10:34:29 AM] John Vocking: Was he the biology teacher and CCF sergeant major
[10/25/23, 10:34:31 AM] John Vocking: ?
[10/25/23, 10:34:54 AM] Andrew Shiells: Bally Bally & Amsterdam are legendary 🙏
[10/25/23, 10:36:46 AM] Dave Wilko: Very sad I remember him as a passionate rugby man
[10/25/23, 10:40:28 AM] Malcolm: He was definitely one of the better ones.
[10/25/23, 10:41:36 AM] Jo Chan: Mr Hearle was a good master. RIP
[10/25/23, 10:50:27 AM] Mark Finch: He was the best. I remember once when we were doing Pavlovs Dog thingymajig, I said “Sir, is that why my mouth waters when I pick my scabs ?”. 
He replied “No, that is just because you are very strange Finch !”.

Then on another occasion, someone fell asleep in one of his lessons. I want to say Zaid. ?! It was the lesson before lunch. 
He just put his finger over his lips, and we all silently tip toed out of the lesson, leaving whoever it was fast asleep !
[10/25/23, 11:01:28 AM] Jon R: Yes to CCF
[10/25/23, 11:27:53 AM] Andrew Shiells: You still pick your scabs with mouth watering affects 🤪
[10/25/23, 7:53:25 PM] James Eason: I remember you saying that about scabs!
[10/25/23, 8:01:41 PM] James Eason: Eric Hearle was a nice and reasonable fellow; good sense of humour and loved all sports, although I recall he was quite a rugby nut.
[10/26/23, 2:34:10 AM] Andrew Marsh: Really sorry to hear about Eric, he encouraged me to join the CCF - which subsequently nudged me to join the Honourable Artillery Company. Still remember Eric doing the slow march around the dining hall.

[11/15/23, 10:44:25 AM] Jo Chan: That I don’t remember as my sport is horrid. If my memory serves me correctly me right, he teach economics.

[11/15/23, 10:47:38 AM] Guy Finney: Richard (Roman) Garrett was economics and still has strong connections with the school especially around supporting foundation students from difficult backgrounds. Surprised he has not got you involved in fund raising if anyone interested I will pass details on.

Amazing how often the school has come up over the years in discussion with clients and friends…so never forgotten, even though I would undoubtedly struggle to name even Capellites in our year now (apart from you Duncan of course!!).
Not exactly sure who’s in this space as more numbers than names but looks like Mark has been busy. 
I live down in Chichester now and am easily persuaded to imbibe ale if you’re ever in the area

[2/7/24, 4:42:31 AM] Nick Carey: Great to hear from you too… to help you put a memory to the number, I’m one of the 2 Nicks (and a John) that you watched An American Werewolf in London with in 1982 🤣
[2/7/24, 4:48:00 AM] ~ Mark Justesen: I still recall that…under 16 on the train and over 18 at the cinema! Remind me who the other Nick was…and was the John a Vocking or a Rigby?
[2/7/24, 5:08:24 AM] John Vocking: Yes it was Guildford wasn’t it. Child train fare to get to Guildford, met in a pub near the station (long since demolished) then to the cinema at the top of the town then back home via pub and Childs train ticket. 😎
[2/7/24, 5:09:16 AM] John Vocking: Or was that Escape from New York?
[2/7/24, 5:56:58 AM] Jon R: Wouldn’t have been me I was about 4ft 2 still in 1982. Would have struggled to get in the equivalent of a PG!!🙃

[2/7/24, 2:09:58 PM] William Pendered: Amazing memories
[2/8/24, 3:51:47 AM] Nick Carey: No, it was defo AWiL - we had to go thru an underpass on the way back to the station (a bit too close to the tube scene 😳) and we chose to dodge the fast traffic on the dual carriageway instead 🤣
The 2 Nick’s were Carey (me) and Haigh, and John Vocking (in case his name doesn’t come up on his post above)
Great memories indeed 😁
[2/8/24, 3:52:59 AM] Nick Carey: IIRC you were in your full punk get up Mark, including a bondage strap, which I just couldn’t get my head around! 🤣
[2/8/24, 3:56:03 AM] ~ Mark Justesen: Was the missing Nick a Mulligan or is my trawl of memory banks flawed?
My fashion sense hasn’t improved much!!

[2/14/24, 1:38:03 PM] Mark Finch: Griff et al smoking behind the bike sheds again ?! 😂
[2/14/24, 1:45:37 PM] Jo Chan: Luckily it is all legal to smoke Cannabis in Canada. 🍁 No DT here guys.
[2/14/24, 1:46:09 PM] Jo Chan: Not as talented as Andy G n Tom H
[2/14/24, 1:46:49 PM] Jo Chan: Hope u guys get lucky tonite. 😂
[2/15/24, 10:57:26 AM] ~ Mark Justesen: Anyone recall a rather scandalous night at a Claremont ball? Johnnie…
[2/15/24, 12:43:41 PM] Jon R: Yes I do. Didn’t we get suspended over that?
[2/15/24, 12:52:04 PM] Tom Hardiment: Hi Mark.
I remember you came with Johnny to meet me in the Red Lion, Barnes in about 89. Welcome to the chat!

Re Claremont; I remember Kieran BH (pissed on cheap sherry) walked through a plate glass window. He was frog-marched to the head teacher and told her she was pig ugly.
Lights went up and Reed's boys told to leave...
Classic B-H
[2/15/24, 12:56:09 PM] Jon R: Mark do you recall Shaun’s stag night…I don’t!
[2/15/24, 12:56:20 PM] Jon R: 🙃
[2/15/24, 1:00:38 PM] ~ Mark Justesen: Might do with a few prompts but not at all yet….was it another horribly drunken affair? 
Kieran Barry-Hawe - blast from the past - remember him being the least athletic until one year they discovered how quick he was and co-opted him to the rugby team. Is he in the group?
[2/15/24, 1:03:21 PM] ~ Mark Justesen: Great to hear from you Tom…I think I recall Barnes but its all rather hazy…a lot of pubs and drunkenness in those days!!
[2/15/24, 1:08:50 PM] Tom Hardiment: Capiche!
Hope to catch up with you at the OR reunion in June
[2/15/24, 1:09:01 PM] Jon R: 2 things I remember only. One ordering drinks in a bar in soho from a dwarf standing on the bar; second us looking for and finding a nightclub where we got in through the exit only to find we’d gone into Heaven !!!
[2/15/24, 1:12:00 PM] ~ Mark Justesen: I ended up their several times in my raving days…always remember the urinals were mirrored and illuminated with pink lighting … a lot of men offered poppers!!
[2/15/24, 1:13:18 PM] ~ Mark Justesen: Apologies for grammar meant ‘there’ (ie Heaven) not ‘their’…shit education!!
[2/16/24, 4:40:13 AM] Mike Nunan: Heaven! I had a semi-regular DJ gig at Megatripolis on Thusdays, some epic sessions we had and also there was a warehouse in Kings Cross where Mutoid Waste Company kept all the modified plant they used for festivals, things like full sized bulldozers with a beak welded on the front of the blade, total madness. We'd have afterparties there that started at 5am. At the club I could get away with playing anything, the place was full of euro techno ravers but I remember having them going nuts on the top of the speakers to Brazilian batucada and big band jazz 😂 Fun times.
[2/16/24, 4:42:15 AM] Mark Finch: I think you and Steve Gates should do a set the night before the reunion day ! Sat 29th June. All we need is a warehouse and some speakers !!!
[2/16/24, 4:42:31 AM] Mark Finch: Any other DJs out there ?
[2/16/24, 4:44:11 AM] Mike Nunan: all for it! can source a system pretty easily if needed, the main thing is where to do it
[2/16/24, 4:44:40 AM] Mike Nunan: anyone got access to some industrial space in the right part of surrey???
[2/16/24, 5:33:49 AM] Tim Clark: How about Reeds gym hall🤗I know how to break in.. used to do that to get my roller skating fix..
[2/16/24, 5:44:02 AM] Mike Nunan: what could possibly go wrong lol
[2/16/24, 5:47:50 AM] Barry Cawston: Dare I suggest Claremont girls school

[2/16/24, 10:39:26 AM] Steve Gates: Clearly we were all trying to look well ‘ard in that photo…. 😂😂😂
[2/16/24, 11:05:31 AM] William Pendered: Us little ones need to stick together 😂 Very funny we always got put together
[2/16/24, 11:06:55 AM] William Pendered: Liking the sounds of a good dj set the night before Finchie. Steve looking forward to the Veg Set
[2/16/24, 11:09:33 AM] Malcolm: Can someone please remind me of the date of the reunion, I assume that Woodlands park will be the most local hotel?
[2/16/24, 11:42:07 AM] William Pendered: Malcolm, check out name of group 🤗
[2/16/24, 11:45:59 AM] Malcolm: Lol, cheers Pixie
[2/16/24, 11:46:14 AM] Malcolm: And the hotel Question?
[2/16/24, 12:29:56 PM] David Edwards: We have 5 spare room (1 being the Motohome in the drive) based in Kingston and a taxi ride from Cobham…anyone who wants to grab a room, I suggest 1st dips! 🤠
[2/16/24, 12:31:46 PM] Barry Cawston: Great idea 
10 to a room it will be like dorms again
[2/16/24, 12:32:22 PM] Barry Cawston: We can get MS 3 to walk up and down the corridors
‎[2/16/24, 12:33:49 PM] Jo Chan: ‎<attached: 00001868-PHOTO-2024-02-16-12-33-49.jpg>
[2/16/24, 12:33:53 PM] David Edwards: Haha…well each room has a double bed and we also have floor space, so again, I repeat, 1st dips, and then you can decide if you want to share! 😂
[2/16/24, 12:35:57 PM] David Edwards: What happened to ‘? Doody’ and ‘Willl? Beavis?
[2/16/24, 1:46:38 PM] Mark Finch: That is probably the year before I joined ! Our/your first form - down at the close !!!  Folks like Dickie Bell, Beldon etc. plus peg leg’s signature at the bottom !!
I joined in the second form !
[2/16/24, 1:51:27 PM] Jo Chan: I was surprised to find this behind the 1978 school photo. Just blink. And 45 years later.
[2/16/24, 2:01:24 PM] William Pendered: Yes please Hotel Edwards 👍
[2/16/24, 2:47:38 PM] Mark Finch: In please Booster !
[2/16/24, 5:17:19 PM] Andy Glass: Me too Booster!
[2/17/24, 2:11:10 AM] Peter Milne: Count me in🍻. Thanks
[2/17/24, 2:51:08 AM] Malcolm: I'll take the last space if it's still available
[2/17/24, 6:37:08 AM] David Edwards: Cool…all places now taken. So room for more, however, it either requires negotiation with one of the others to share a double bed, floor space with mat and sleeping bag, or the top bunk in the Motorhome, as Malcolm has grabbed the main bed, being the last in! 🤠
[2/17/24, 7:16:29 AM] Malcolm: 😊 thanks Dave
[2/17/24, 11:27:17 AM] Mike Nunan: Dayum, this is what I get for missing a day's traffic on here lol. Holiday Inn is nice according to Ice Cube, maybe I'll try there 😉
[2/20/24, 10:53:51 AM] ~ Mark Justesen: Hi folks…with the Edwards Hotel fully booked am exploring hotels/mates’ floors etc but wouldn’t want to be miles from any Saturday night action. 
The rave would trump all but otherwise wondering if a return to the Vic would round off a trip down memory lane. 
What do people think?
[2/20/24, 11:24:34 AM] James Eason: I’d be up for booking a hotel for a night if there’s a juicy piss-up on the cards for Saturday night.
[2/20/24, 1:23:03 PM] Paul Rushton: It’s a gastropub nowadays
[2/20/24, 1:31:27 PM] ~ Mark Justesen: Ok, Paul, noted…definitely not thinking about the 40 years elapsed!!
I was really just feeling out if there was any interest in planning some sort of informal piss up on the Saturday…always nicer than a Sunday night.
Any thoughts anyone?
[2/20/24, 3:08:34 PM] Mark Finch: It’s an absolute YES from me, plus I suspect all those staying at Boosters ! I’d suggest somewhere “local”, Cobham, Esher, Claygate etc.
[2/21/24, 6:05:46 AM] Nick Carey: Just coz it’s a gastro-pub now and there’s no tiger ride outside any more doesn’t mean it’s not still packed with memories of course… 😉

[2/26/24, 3:00:50 PM] Barry Cawston: Too late
[2/26/24, 3:21:37 PM] Barry Cawston: 1-0 to the miniature wizard

Pix odds on 

Taking bets
[2/26/24, 3:48:00 PM] Barry Cawston: 1 a piece or peace 
Reed’s spelling
[2/26/24, 4:18:47 PM] Barry Cawston: Decider

The decider continues
[2/26/24, 11:23:37 PM] Mark Finch: The suspense is unbearable. Or don’t tell me - you both fell asleep with your heads on the table and just waking up ?!
[2/27/24, 1:54:31 AM] Barry Cawston: A double 6 and a double five on the run in got Pixie the win but two pairs in poker bought me the cash so honours even
[2/27/24, 2:32:18 AM] David Edwards: Pix is not using those loaded dice again…also Pix, thought you may have learnt your lesson at Griffs playing pissed after an OR’s dinner!! 😂
[2/27/24, 2:37:57 AM] Andrew Shiells: Didn’t realise poker was a two person game 🤪
[2/27/24, 2:41:37 AM] William Pendered: It all made sense at the time. Head hurts as it does visiting Barry 😔

[4/5/24, 5:32:25 AM] Jon R: It’s dandruff Nick 😑
[4/15/24, 10:47:27 AM] David Edwards: In regards to Sat 29th - Currently The Edwards Hotel is hosting; Pix, Finchie, Mr G, Peter M, Malcolm, and Wilco (in his VW)….there is still one more space in the Motorhome and floor space (or dovetailing with one of the others!)….Appreciate Sunday is a school night, but does anyone also need a room on Sunday 30th after the event. Happy to accommodate!
[4/15/24, 10:50:05 AM] David Edwards: Finchie….as our new chief whip; do you have any thoughts or ideas for where we might go on Saturday Evening? I see in the history, The Vic has been mentioned. Just thought we might want to think about booking some space where ever we decide to end up?
[4/15/24, 11:39:25 AM] Andrew Shiells: Vic is not really a pub anymore and expensive food. Plus if Wilko parking his van at yours it would be more convenient/ easier going into Kingston 🤔
[4/15/24, 11:49:36 AM] Mark Finch: I’ll chat to Shamaine this week about logistics and timing and then send a “Whose In” on this group !! 

See who is living / staying where. Gut feel says Esher might be a good drinking place for Sat night ? See if we can reserve the Albert upstairs, then there is that dodgy  joint for afters ?!
[4/15/24, 11:51:07 AM] James Eason: I like the idea of either of Cobham or Esher, or is the sixth form bar still functioning and we could destroy that?
[4/15/24, 11:58:28 AM] Chris: I think Cobham or Esher .. I'll probably stay at Sarah's mum in Oxshott
[4/15/24, 12:01:13 PM] James Eason: And I’d then book a hotel room nearby, in case a clean get away is required.
[4/17/24, 1:40:58 AM] Alex Coomes: May I suggest if the weather is clement that my brewery tap Platform 3 might be a good place to imbibe. It is located  next to Claygate station (one stop up from Oxshott) drinking is all outside but it has form as some present Reeds  teachers drown their sorrows of entering the teaching profession on Friday nights
[4/17/24, 2:53:25 AM] Jon R: 👍
[4/17/24, 4:51:54 AM] Mark Finch: Hi Alex - sorry a bit slammed with work today as was on calls - sorry I didn’t pick up. You’ve used a word Proctor never taught me - but sounds like a FAB idea !!! I’ll call you at the weekend.
[4/24/24, 6:34:00 AM] William Pendered: https://networkreeds.org/ReunionDay2024
[4/24/24, 6:37:07 AM] William Pendered: hi All. I just received the invite for ORs day 30 June. Email says because of demand (Finchie's fault ) numbers are limited so it's on a first come basis. So get skates on, if you don't have email, I have copied on line application above. Also if you do want invite then if you PM me I can send on to Sharmaine or even just forward you the email. Game on!
[4/24/24, 7:27:25 AM] Nick Carey: Registered - but no mention of bringing a plus one? Wives defo invited last time I went (10? Years ago). 
On the Saturday drinking front, Alex’s tap bar sounds great, but I am a little worried about my creature comforts… I’m a fat old man and need a comfy chair! Looking at getting a room at the Woodlands unless anyone has any other recommendations?
[4/24/24, 7:42:24 AM] William Pendered: Agree on Alex's tap bar, even if we turn up as a part of the night there
[4/24/24, 8:30:04 AM] ~ Mark Justesen: Also registered…
[4/24/24, 8:42:40 AM] Andrew Marsh: I’ve registered - Nick, no mention on the form of wives - notwithstanding chance of getting Ingrid along are nil. She will no doubt be off at a horse thing anyway.

[4/25/24, 12:28:16 PM] Malcolm: Dear Malcolm

 

I hope this finds you well.  How fascinating that you have signed up to Reunion Day on 30th June as I don’t think we have ever been in touch!

 

I see you were only at the School for two years, so could you kindly confirm your house and dates?  I assume you left I assume early but are in contact with Mark Finch:

 

With thanks and kind regards

Sharmaine
[4/25/24, 12:29:03 PM] Malcolm: I wonder if she has found out I was asked to leave 😂
[4/25/24, 12:29:19 PM] Mark Finch: All good Malcolm - I spoke to her today !!!
[4/25/24, 12:30:05 PM] Mark Finch: BTW - Spaces going fast ! 15 of us signed up so far ! Nice work ! 
Let’s get to 20 !!!!
[4/25/24, 12:30:07 PM] James Eason: It’s an interesting point, because I left in 1982 and therefore not a 1984 leaver, but of course from 1977 and across the years we were all the gang together. So stick to your guns.
[4/25/24, 12:30:36 PM] Mark Finch: PS sorry @447305534304 , no parters !
[4/25/24, 12:31:53 PM] Malcolm: I'm keener on the Saturday night drinks than the Sunday Reunion 😁
[4/25/24, 12:32:05 PM] Peter Milne: Registered 🍻
[4/25/24, 12:33:08 PM] Peter Milne: I also left in 1982, so let's see what happens
[4/25/24, 12:35:11 PM] John Vocking: It was first advertised as 82 and 84 leavers so you should be ok
[4/25/24, 12:50:56 PM] Mark Finch: All good PeteM. This is what she had at mid-day today …

[4/27/24, 12:06:16 AM] David Edwards: I don’t, however, will speak to his sister Debbie. 🙏🏻
[4/27/24, 12:37:35 AM] David Edwards: Just spoke with Griff, he is also trying to find out more details.
[4/27/24, 1:05:07 AM] David Edwards: Please see an update on Wolfie from his sister Debbie…..He  is in Kingston ITU on a ventilator 😞 He got an infection which kicked off his asthma and went into respiratory failure on weds night. He is sedated due to the ventilator but is stable. They were hoping to remove the ventilator yesterday but he wasn’t quite ready, it’s a bit of a waiting game. But my view is that whilst he is very unwell, the doctors are quite positive. 
I will try to coordinate a visit with her but visitation is highly restricted. I will will update you when we know more 🙏🏻
[4/27/24, 1:08:23 AM] Dave Wilko: 🤞🤞
[4/27/24, 1:24:49 AM] William Pendered: thanks Dave (s)

[4/27/24, 6:33:14 AM] Mike Nunan: thanks for the ping Finchie, I've been totally under it the last few days and had seen it but only playing catch-up now, will register and hope there's still room for me
[4/27/24, 6:34:40 AM] Mike Nunan: in other news, I've been in contact with James Grist, after sending him a birthday txt
[4/27/24, 6:35:11 AM] Mike Nunan: I'd tried him on WhatsApp last year to no avail and thought perhaps it'd been too long to pick up our friendship again, but not at all, he and his partner are coming to stay with us in a few weekends time
[4/27/24, 6:36:00 AM] Mike Nunan: I tried to tempt him for the reunion but he wanted to have a think on that and maybe decide after our hookup, guess with the numbers restriction that might rule him out but I'll let him know the deal on that in case he wants to just take the plunge
[4/27/24, 6:38:53 AM] Mark Finch: Jimmy !!!!
[4/27/24, 6:44:12 AM] Mike Nunan: well the site let me register and I got back a confirmation of registration, not clear if that means I'm 100% coming...

[4/28/24, 7:51:49 AM] David Edwards: I went to see Wolfie’s sister, Debbie, yesterday, and helped her celebrate her birthday and pass on all your best wishes to Neil. Wolfie would be proud of our hangovers and it was great release value for Debbie in these very difficult times.

I also visited Wolfie today at the ICU and he is under heavy sedation to support his ventilation, and while he seems stable he is in ICU for a reason, so still on 24 watch. The unit prefers to restrict visitors outside family, however, even under sedation, apparently he can hear who is in the room. So I passed on your best wishes and updated him on all the various messages regarding the forthcoming reunion.  I will regularly check in with Debbie and will keep you all updated if there are any majors changes.

[5/1/24, 12:50:39 AM] Zaid Tuaima: Best wishes to Neil. Hoping for a quick recovery and to be off the ventilator soon. Pls pass my regards if you see him again. Which hospital?

[5/4/24, 8:33:37 AM] Malcolm: Flight booked from the Ise of Man, looking forward to catching up with all who will be their for the Saturday night or the Sunday
[5/13/24, 10:18:11 AM] David Edwards: Just come back for seeing Wolfie at Kingston Hospital as he is now out of ITU and currently resident in Hammel Ward, Esher Wing. While clearly not out of the woods, he seems to be on the long road to recovery and wanted to thank you for all your best wishes, he was really touched! He is also bloody determined to try and make it on the 30th, so Finchie, not sure you can have a word to ensure there is a spare space if he can?…his mobile phone is currently not working, so hasn’t responded on the WhatsApp Group recently, but hopes to do so soon! He thinks they might discharge him by end of week, however, if you are in Kingston and have time to visit, I am sure he would appreciate it. Visitation is 8-8, and if you do go, he would probably appreciate chocolate biscuits and a Sun Newspaper, as you can’t seem to buy them on site. He has an enough for a couple of days after my visit! I am off to France for the next few weeks, but will catch up with him on my return….That’s all from me for now…looking forward to seeing many of you either on 29th evening at Alex’s Brewery in Claygate or at the Reeds Lunch on 30th…cheers….D ‎<This message was edited>
[5/13/24, 11:46:17 AM] Mark Finch: Thanks for the update Booster. I’ll have a word for 30th !
[5/14/24, 5:40:40 AM] Tim Clark: So… without lots of scrolling to find out. Where is the Saturday eve session? Claygate… Cobham…somewhere else. Cheers gents
[5/14/24, 6:07:19 AM] Mark Finch: Don’t scroll Tim !! Nothing exists ! Up until a moment ago ……
[5/14/24, 6:14:16 AM] Mark Finch: So here is the cunning plan, as we have an actual real life brewer in amongst us. Thanks for offering up you venue Alex Coombes @447802316389 !!! 

Schedule: 

Sat c 6pm gather at Platform 3 Claygate Station. That is the location of the pub …
https://www.brightbrew.co.uk/


C. 8pm: Then flip to the curry house nearby 
https://www.rasoy.co.uk
Great place to eat.

That leaves plenty of time for those after late night shenanigans ..

C. 10pm to any option like Esher, Kingston etc !
[5/14/24, 6:17:21 AM] Mark Finch: That means the only thing I need to book is the curry for 8pm, so lots of flexibility. 

Those in for the curry, please put a thumbs up on this message. 

For those that have no idea how to put a thumbs up on a message - ask your wife/girlfriend/child/partner !!! (Or Google it). 

Saves me scrolling ;-) ‎<This message was edited>

I don’t have many Facebook friends and incredibly Facebook informed me this morning that FIVE of my friends have a birthday today ! Including my mother !!! 

Pottsy can give us the maths and stats around that 😂

[6/5/24, 9:06:30 AM] David Edwards: Enjoy my friend! Have a fab one 😎
[6/5/24, 9:06:59 AM] Duncan Darroch-Warren: Thank you!
[6/5/24, 9:08:10 AM] Barry Cawston: Not going to make the Reed’s weekend but would be lovely to meet up in London sometime with one and all 

The Toucan in Soho for guiness springs to mind
[6/5/24, 9:13:28 AM] Mark Finch: I think Pottsy has plans to be back in the UK in October for his Dads birthday, so perhaps around then and we can do some quadratic equation practice at the Toucan !
[6/5/24, 9:15:28 AM] Barry Cawston: Ha ha 
I’ll just try and get a nice photo of the perfect pint
[6/5/24, 9:58:12 AM] Peter Potts: I will be around in the UK in the first half of October (no flight tickets yet).
My father is 90 on October 5th.
I can go over analytic solutions for cubics and quartics too if you like :) ‎<This message was edited>
[6/5/24, 11:56:59 AM] Mike Nunan: Be great to see you Pete, maths or no maths 😜
[6/5/24, 11:57:24 AM] Mike Nunan: Happy Birthday Barry!
[6/5/24, 12:12:56 PM] Guy Finney: I would be up for a meet up with Pete as I can not make the main get together in June any siggestion on location and date?
[6/5/24, 12:27:45 PM] Mark Finch: How about Saturday 12th October ? As Barry suggested, up in Soho at the Toucan (or nearby).  Could do lunchtime onwards ? 
All nice and central and easy for most to get to !! Would that work Pottsy ? @16504609902
[6/5/24, 12:28:44 PM] Guy Finney: In the diary look forward to it
[6/5/24, 12:47:14 PM] Mike Nunan: any date first half of October is good for me
[6/5/24, 6:18:07 PM] Peter Potts: Saturday 12th October sounds good to me! From lunch to late night is good.
[6/5/24, 7:18:52 PM] Giles Solomon: Looks like I will just miss this one! Currently scheduled for a fleeting visit to the UK around 19 Oct. Next time!
[6/6/24, 7:18:25 AM] Peter Potts: I could do 19 Oct if that works better for everybody.
[6/6/24, 8:05:31 AM] Mark Finch: Superb - that makes much more sense ! Bringing together California and the Gold Coast in Aus (I think Giles ?!) !
[6/6/24, 1:41:22 PM] Giles Solomon: Hey Pottsy, Finchie. Kind of you to think about moving the date and would love to see you all. I’m still finalising flights etc. Good chance 19th will work but not sure what flight from Spain I’m coming in on yet. Conscious also to make sure that any change of date doesn’t mess around others who were ok for the 12th. Should know more in the days ahead 👍.
[6/6/24, 1:44:37 PM] Mark Finch: Giles - we need results - not excuses ! Keep us appraised my friend.
[6/6/24, 3:18:53 PM] Barry Cawston: I am doing the affordable art fair in Battersea weds- Sunday if anybody fancies swinging by 

My gallery The Drugstore is exhibiting but should be able to meet up around 7:30/ 8pm 

Perfect ! 

We have 40 years to catch up on
[6/6/24, 3:21:19 PM] Mark Finch: Baz - dates help ! We talking this Wed to Sunday ? Or October ?
[6/6/24, 3:25:49 PM] Barry Cawston: Ha ha no October 
16th -20th 

And free tickets 
For all days and cocktail Private Views Weds and Thursday 

It’s fun
[6/6/24, 3:27:20 PM] Barry Cawston: Be lovely to see you Mark and thanks for pulling all of us folk back together 

Can’t have been easy

[6/7/24, 5:44:51 AM] Tim Clark: With 3 postcards there I noticed. A few names on the wall i have heard of. Was that on the Pentax or bigger format?

[6/18/24, 2:03:10 AM] Giles Solomon: Hey Finchie/Gents. Can now confirm I’m good for 19th Oct! I’ll be flying in from Malaga that day so just need to know proposed start time, so I can make sure my (yet-to-be-booked) flight gets me in to London with enough time to spare to ensure a relaxed arrival at the Toucan 😉.
[6/18/24, 2:07:41 AM] Barry Cawston: Just been thinking in the Toucan which maybe not the best venue as you tend to want to stand outside and likely to be on the cold side 

Let’s think on … be good to hear ourselves talk as well 😁
[6/18/24, 7:30:05 AM] Peter Potts: I haven't booked flight tickets yet but 19th is good otherwise.
[6/20/24, 7:39:41 AM] Mark Finch: ‎Mark Finch pinned a message
[6/20/24, 12:51:19 AM] David Edwards: Thanks for the itinerary Finchie, so suggest @447917428535, @41788323200, @447889646381, @447495602526 @447624307738, @447768172632, who are planning to stay at mine, I suggest you arrive no later than 17.00. My address is 91, Arundel Road, Kingston, Surrey, KT1 3RY. Closest Rail station is Norbiton. If anyone else is stuck for somewhere to stay, we still have floor space for blowup mattress and sleeping bag, or negotiate with others to go top to tail and every bed is a double! 🤠…
[6/20/24, 1:34:47 AM] Andy Glass: Cheers Dave - Playing cricket so will be a bit later. Will take an Uber from yours and meet you all at the brewery - looking forward to seeing everyone!
[6/20/24, 3:13:15 AM] Andrew Shiells: Bowl first get a quick 50 then leave you’ll be there by 5 😜
[6/20/24, 3:18:37 AM] Malcolm: Nice to know I'm not the only old bloke still trying to play cricket
[6/20/24, 3:37:24 AM] Andy Glass: Good effort! Takes me until about Wednesday to walk properly again!
[6/20/24, 7:53:18 AM] Peter Potts: If you are short a player, my brother Chris still plays cricket.
[6/20/24, 12:44:31 PM] Peter Milne: Count me in for the curry @447917428535
[6/20/24, 12:48:43 PM] Mark Finch: Already done ;-) Table for 15 confirmed - which covers those that said yes (and a few staying at Boosters who were a bit fooking slow in the uptake) !! 
There will be flexibility !

Can’t wait !

[6/25/24, 11:07:34 PM] Mark Finch: 😂 Baileys it is !
[6/26/24, 1:51:08 PM] Mark Finch: OK team - it’s getting real ! The lovely Sharmaine phoned me today to ask what’s the seating plan for Sunday ! I said “make it random”. 😃 So apologies in advance if you are next to Shiellsy or Booster ! 

We have 2 tables of 10. Apparently the Headmaster will be on one. He is Mr Hoskins (and “No” nothing to do with the legend that said “Right Finch you are in the choir, because I know you don’t want to be” !). I did think about putting G next to him - but then my eyes bled with the memory of his relationship with Davey P 😂 

Hope you all noted “no jeans” on the dress code. That’s completely f*cked me. May have to go shopping on Saturday ! 

Probably my last Comms before Sat - as I still have to work and head into a busy couple of days.

I will leave you with a remaining thought “apparently the England game is on at 5pm on Sunday”, so just considering how I don’t have to drive !!! 

See a handful (15) of you at the Tap at Claygate station.

Weirdly, I can’t wait to see you all !!
[6/26/24, 2:01:30 PM] Mark Finch: BTW - don’t be shocked - Wolfie will be in wheelchair. After an incredibly tough year. He’ll probably only stay for an hour or so - but I can’t wait to see him and support him ! His sister and Booster have been legends in co-ordinating. I think it will be special !
[6/26/24, 2:23:09 PM] Jo Chan: Hope u guys will have a jolly good time, sorry I can’t be there, please send photos, especially after u all had too many Alex’s beer🍺 Thinking of u from 3000 miles west.
[6/26/24, 2:33:12 PM] John Vocking: Did Sharmaine have a guest list?
[6/26/24, 2:37:47 PM] Mark Finch: As in “Tom Hardy”, “Tim Henman” etc ? 
Probably not !
She rapidly reeled off names. I think the “ACID” test, is if you got the email, you’re in. If not, probably not registered. 
Did you get an email John? Or just curious who else is going ? I jotted it down somewhere - but will take me 24 hours to figure out where !
[6/26/24, 3:03:51 PM] John Vocking: Email found. My isp seems to be convinced that it was junk. Reeds emails are the only ones they have stored in over ten years🙄
 Maybe my browsing history leads them to believe i could not have had a public school upbringing 😳🤣
[6/26/24, 3:12:00 PM] Mark Finch: Hahaha !
[6/27/24, 4:51:13 AM] Nick Carey: Attendee list on the OR site - https://networkreeds.org/#action=showEvent&EID=E83
[6/27/24, 4:52:57 AM] Nick Carey: Reading this thread and the comments about the quality of the Public School education we received, I think it’s probably right for all of us 🤣
[6/27/24, 5:03:41 AM] William Pendered: Brilliant: 22 of us

[6/27/24, 5:06:14 AM] William Pendered: Great to also see a couple of OR legends going to be there: George Spinks & John Rogers (yes, he is still going!)- left Reeds 78 years ago 😅 , how many of us will be there in say 40 years from now?
[6/27/24, 5:17:57 AM] Jon R: Me - would probably have to holograph in by then. Or send in my younger looking clone….
[6/27/24, 11:17:55 AM] Steve Gates: Gentlemen - really looking forward to seeing so many of you on Saturday evening/Sunday, and looking forward to travelling up from Exeter to see you all. In advance of this weekend please can I say that I have been to a single school reunion (Rome) event about 10 years ago and have not done a lot of thinking about school for most of the past 40 years (not because of some repressed trauma - I don’t think! - but just because life has intervened). Since I can barely remember what I was doing 40 days ago I apologise in advance if I can’t remember the joyful/awful/embarrassing things that we might have got up to - however it’s me, not you 😳😳😂😂
[6/27/24, 11:31:55 AM] Peter Milne: Totally agree. 40 years is a long time, and, unlike some of you, I haven't seen anybody for that length of time. I remember names and some experiences, mainly based around sports, but I am really looking forward to the chance to reconnect.
[6/27/24, 11:39:11 AM] Peter Milne: @447768686201 it has been so long and really looking forward to catching up on Saturday. What is the parking set up around your house?
[6/27/24, 11:43:14 AM] Peter Potts: I feel like I'm really missing out here. Have a great night. I'd also be concerned about remembering much. There are important events in my life that I can't even believed happened. Only photos prove that it did. Anyway, I hope I get to see some of you on October 19th.
[6/27/24, 11:58:17 AM] James Eason: I suspect that we all be having a rush of flashbacks, and if those don’t come as thick and fast as I would expect, then we will be ably and remorselessly reminded  before long. Hugely looking forward to it, hoping to come up for a beer on the Saturday, but I have another engagement that might overrun, most likely I’ll be there For Sunday‘s PTSD Support Group.
[6/27/24, 12:03:47 PM] Barry Cawston: Enjoy fellas xx
[6/27/24, 12:09:41 PM] James Eason: That said, Andrew Marsh and I went back there about eight years ago for a reunion day and, frankly, it was a delight to be back there and to see many of the old faces and masters.
[6/27/24, 12:22:51 PM] ~ Mark Justesen: I may be a little later than 6.00 but similarly looking forward to meeting you all again after so long, and to delving into the archives .
[6/27/24, 12:35:15 PM] William Pendered: Pete, parking at Dave's is no problem
[6/27/24, 12:36:29 PM] William Pendered: So looking forward to seeing you all. It will be fun I'm sure
[6/27/24, 2:12:21 PM] John Vocking: I remember a surprising amount about Reed’s 😳. Not much about last week though 😢
[6/27/24, 2:16:09 PM] Dave Wilko: Looking forward to meeting up for a beer and a curry on Saturday 
Unfortunately I have double booked myself on Sunday so won’t be able to make the lunch now
[6/27/24, 2:42:07 PM] David Edwards: There’s always one! 🙄
[6/27/24, 3:51:32 PM] Mark Finch: I love the fact we are all “getting our excuses in early”. “Who exactly are you” 😂😂😂

It will all be fine - and frankly brilliant !!!
[6/27/24, 10:40:02 PM] Giles Solomon: Greetings from Bali 😊🙏. Enjoy Gents 👍. Am sure it will be a very enjoyable and nostalgic weekend. Are there actually still any Masters alive from 40 years ago! I have positive memories of Alan King, Basil G, Mr Proctor & Mr Warnock. Nicky Heather was ok, although responsible for interrogation techniques that the CIA would be proud of, resulting in 6 of the finest administered by Basil! Also remember Mr Stedman, who I sat next to in the school orchestra. Always smelt of alcohol for evening practice (no euphemisms intended 🤣). There’s really no one who had a detrimental effect on my future life, so please pass my best to any you run into. Look forward to seeing some of you in October. Cheers.
[6/29/24, 12:31:41 AM] S-P: Good morning, guys. Greetings from sunny Transylvania! I’m sorry not to be there & I wish you a brilliant weekend! Best, S-P
[6/29/24, 12:33:32 AM] David Edwards: Thanks Simon…hopefully lots of pics and we will see you at a future event!
[6/29/24, 1:31:22 AM] Mark Finch: Hey All - Wilco can’t make it on Sunday - so anyone suffering FOMO - let me know and we can do a name tag swap ?!
[6/29/24, 1:32:24 AM] Andrew Shiells: Or let’s just mix up name tags and see who notices 😝
[6/29/24, 1:34:01 AM] Steve Gates: “My, Mr Gates you’ve grown very tall since you left Reeds: you were always one of the smallest in the year….”?? 😂😂😂
[6/29/24, 1:40:06 AM] Mark Finch: 😂😂😂
[6/29/24, 2:18:14 AM] John Vocking: Is it definite that no partners are invited?
[6/29/24, 2:22:33 AM] Andrew Shiells: I would say if there’s an empty seat and no other leaver can fill it. Plus she can drive you back so you can have a few then why not what do you say captain Finch? Any plus ones can pitch up for afternoon tea anyway 🤗
[6/29/24, 2:23:45 AM] Mark Finch: Yes - as I checked with Sharmaine
[6/29/24, 2:25:19 AM] Mark Finch: You are so transparent Shiella ! Inviting Debbie for tea so you have a lift back. That is a massive fine !!!!
[6/29/24, 2:29:42 AM] William Pendered: Finchie not so quick thi, we might be able to leverage the lift to get to see footie?? 😉
[6/29/24, 2:30:33 AM] Andrew Shiells: Footie has been mentioned in my cunning logistics 😜
[6/29/24, 2:35:07 AM] Mark Finch: In !!! 

I am NOT looking forward to Monday !!!!

[6/29/24, 9:34:27 AM] Tim Clark: Pretty sure I had  more but I won’t ever find them now. These were on their last legs. Not having kids myself this maybe the last time I see them as physical photos…

[6/30/24, 8:51:16 AM] Steve Gates: So lovely to see you all again - what a great evening/afternoon. Hats off to Francis and Sacha who “endured” us through the tour - must be like taking a large group of slightly grumpy uncles around your school, who have to stop every 100 yards to say this wasn’t here when I was here/do you remember when this was all grass/can’t believe how good the facilities are now ..etc.. 😂😂😂

[6/30/24, 9:51:11 AM] Nick Carey: And, more importantly, @447917428535 , how much do we owe for last night’s beers?

[6/30/24, 12:02:17 PM] Dave Wilko: 👍
[6/30/24, 12:04:52 PM] Mark Finch: So just to tidy up the financial loose ends !!! Which ended up as great value !!! 

There were basically 3 “buckets” of costs 
1) Uber, after curry house shenanigans (the bear), Platform 3
